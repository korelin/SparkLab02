This course is not a series of independent lessons, but a deeper, more focused, unified look into the structure of English. Participants quickly discover that all English sentences follow the same principles by identifying the places contained in every sentence and the types of relationships and phrases found in those places. From day one, participants describe English sentences in a simple, straightforward manner and are able to apply this information for editing purposes. These skills facilitate the teaching and learning of other languages as well. Course content is taken from linguistics and adapted to language teaching and learning. Course content is cumulative, applies directly to every sentence, and becomes the method for describing how words and phrases are combined into sentences to create meaning. X-words (traditionally called auxiliary verbs or helping verbs) are our keys for unlocking and revealing the hidden structure of every sentence. Class content is provided through the X-Word Grammar online video series available at  the X-Word Grammar Store. Subscription cost is $15. The philosophy of X-Word Grammar: The simple sentence is a unique approach and quite different than any other grammar you have ever studied. It is logical, useful, and interesting! If you want to learn about the structure of the English sentence, this class is for you. Try it. You will like it!"}

We will examine the phenomenon of modern terrorism, the development of the al Qai'da ideology, and the process by which individuals radicalize towards violence. The attacks of September 11, 2001, were a seminal moment in modern history. They demonstrated the ability of non-state actors to inflict serious damage on the world's greatest superpower and exposed the vulnerability of the entire global community to catastrophic acts of terrorism. To understand the causes of the attacks, 9/11 and Its Aftermath -- Part I will examine the phenomenon of terrorism, in general, and, more specifically, the radical ideology developed and propagated by Osama bin Laden through al Qai'da. We will consider why individuals are attracted to this ideology and how they radicalize to violence. We will also explore the way in which the United States addressed terrorism prior to 9/11 and the policy challenges it (and its allies around the globe) faced in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. The second part of this course -- to be offered sometime in 2014 -- will examine the policy \"aftermath\" of 9/11. Part II will examine how the United States changed its policies in response to 9/11 in three areas: the use of military force, law enforcement and intelligence activities, and homeland security. We will trace the evolution of these policies from the Bush to the Obama Administration and critically assess the overall counter-terrorism strategy.&nbsp;Together, these courses will provide the background necessary to understand why 9/11 occurred, and consider the range of options that democratic nations can use to counteract this form of political violence. &nbsp;Syllabus\nCourse TopicsWeek 1: The 9/11 AttacksWeek 2: What is Terrorism?Week 3: A Primer on IslamWeek 4: The Al Qai'da IdeologyWeek 5: The Radicalization ProcessWeek 6: Counterterrorism Pre-9/11Week 7: September 12, 2001Recommended Background\nNo background is required. Suggested Readings\nThere will be weekly readings that will either be provided as PDFs or as links. You will not be required to buy any texts. If you are interested in learning more, I can highly recommend Lawrence Wright's The Looming Tower and The 9/11 Commission Report.Course Format\nEach week will consist of lecture videos, readings, and an assessment. Along with content lectures by Professor Schanzer, there will be videos of student discussions and interviews with various experts. There will be multiple opportunities for engagement with fellow students and Professor Schanzer through Google Hangouts and the discussion forums.Students will submit weekly posts commenting on an aspect of the materials. In addition, there will be either a quiz or peer assessment for each topic. Students will be asked to think critically about the subject matter and form their own opinions -- this is not a course with right and wrong answers. Rather, it is designed to provide the information necessary to engage in informed debate about difficult issues, think critically, assess tradeoffs, and express your own opinions. FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?Yes. Students who successfully complete the class with a 70% or better will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. Students who complete the class with a 85% or better will receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction. The Signature Track will be available for this course.What is the code of ethics for this course?There is an ethics code relating to your work for the course and participation on the discussion forums. Students will be required to agree to the Coursera Honor Code, which requires that students do their own work and act honorably on assessments. Vibrant and open discussion will be encourage on the discussion forums. Education is advanced by exposure to a full range of ideas and vigorous exchange of perspectives and opinions. Nonetheless, comments that make no contribution to thoughtful discourse and appear to be intended primarily to offend, intimidate, demean, or stifle other will not be tolerated. Posts that violate this standard will be removed from the forums and students unwilling to abide by this standard will be removed from the course.What is the most important thing I will learn about in this class?The main objective of the course is to teach students to think critically about controversial, important issues. You will learn to form opinions and craft arguments that are based on facts and substance, not mere feelings or conjecture. You will be exposed to the wide variety of opinion around the globe about the ideas promoted by al Qai\u2019da and like minded groups and the origins of the 9/11 attacks. The course will provide you the basis to be an informed participant in these discussions and debates. You will not be taught what to think or believe about these issues. Rather, you will be provided background information and exposure to ideas so you can to develop your own views and reach your own conclusions from an informed perspective.\u00a0\u00a0 "}

It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and\u00a0environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological).

Why is it the way it is? How does it affect the rest of the world? Professor Bruce Jentleson has taught the subject for over 30 years, written one of the leading books on it, and has served in numerous U.S. foreign policy positions. U.S. foreign policy has a huge impact on the world. That impact is widely debated among Americans and by people in many countries. Our goal in this course is to gain more understanding of what U.S. foreign policy is, who makes it, why is it the way it is, and how it affects the rest of the world. Through lectures, readings, and other course elements we build on the information available from the media and other such sources while delving deeper into the issues, their history, their broader context and major debates. We seek to do so as a community of learning committed not only to the curricular objectives for our course, but seeking to demonstrate to the world how to conduct informed and respectful discourse on subjects which have plenty of room for disagreement.The first week of the course provides an overview and analytic framework, and focuses in on the process and politics by which U.S. foreign policy is made. Each of the next five weeks is geared to U.S. foreign policy in different\nregions: Asia with a particular focus on U.S.-China relations; the Middle East and such issues as Iran, Arab-Israeli peace, Syria, and the Arab uprisings; relations with Western Europe and Russia; relations in the Western Hemisphere with Latin America\nand Canada; and key issues in U.S.-Africa relations.

Each of these units will have four or five components consisting of a video lecture, background readings, quizzes and other learning reinforcement exercises. We also will use\nthe message board and other mechanisms for dialogue among the students and with the professor and teaching team.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nWhat resources will I need for this class? For this course, all you need is an Internet connection and the time to read, write, discuss, and think about our topic.\nIs this course only for Americans? Definitely not.

Will I get a certificate after completing\nthis class?\nYes. Students who successfully\ncomplete all class assignments will receive a certificate signed by the\ninstructor.\nDo\nI earn Emory University credits upon completion of this class?\nNo. The certificate of completion\nis not transferable for course credit at Emory University. It is good, however,\nfor demonstrating how much initiative and stick-to-a-tiveness you have (it is\ngoing to take time out of your life every week for more than two months after\nall). In addition, should anyone ever say: \u201cOh yeah? So what makes YOU an\nexpert on HIV/AIDS?\u201d you can always say: \u201cTHIS does!\u201d and shake your certificate\nin their face. That should shut them up.What resources will I need for this class?Curiosity, an open mind, time to watch videos, a commitment to engage with your fellow students in discussions of the material, and a tolerance for the fact that the instructor tends to live by the motto: \"Just because I take my science seriously doesn't mean I have to take myself seriously.\"What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?Yeah, right .... Like I'm going to give away the punch line before you enroll in the class.\n"}

The course aims to provide a foundation in artificial intelligence techniques for planning, with an overview of the wide spectrum of different problems and approaches, including their underlying theory and their applications. It will allow you to:\nUnderstand different planning problems\nHave the basic know how to design and implement AI planning systems\nKnow how to use AI planning technology for projects in different application domains\nHave the ability to make use of AI planning literature\nPlanning is a fundamental part of intelligent systems. In this course, for example, you will learn the basic algorithms that are used in robots to deliberate over a course of actions to take. Simpler, reactive robots don't need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Introduction and Planning in Context\nWeek 2: State-Space Search: Heuristic Search and STRIPSWeek 3: Plan-Space Search and HTN Planning\nOne week catch up break\nWeek 4: Graphplan and Advanced Heuristics\nWeek 5: Plan Execution and Applications\nExam week\nThe January 2015 session&nbsp;was the final version of the course. It will remain open so that those interested can register and access all the materials.Recommended Background\nThe MOOC is based on a Masters level course at the University of Edinburgh but is designed to be accessible at several levels of engagement from an \"Awareness Level\", through the core \"Foundation Level\" requiring a basic knowledge of logic and mathematical reasoning, to a more involved \"Performance Level\" requiring programming and other assignments.Suggested Readings\nThe course follows a text book, but this is not required for the course:&nbsp;\nAutomated Planning: Theory &amp; Practice (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence) by M. Ghallab, D. Nau, and P. Traverso (Elsevier, ISBN 1-55860-856-7) 2004.Course Format\nFive weeks of study comprising 10 hours of video lecture material and special features videos. Quizzes and assessments throughout the course will assist in learning. Some weeks will involve recommended readings. Discussion on the course forum and via other social media will be encouraged. A mid-course catch up break week and a final week for exams and completion of assignments allows for flexibility in study.\nYou can engage with the course at a number of levels to suit your interests and the time you have available:\nAwareness Level - gives an overview of the topic, along with introductory videos and application related features. This level is likely to require 2-3 hours of study per week.\nFoundation Level - is the core taught material on the course and gives a grounding in AI planning technology and algorithms. This level is likely to require 5-6 hours of study per week of study.\nPerformance Level - is for those interested in carrying out additional programming assignments and engaging in creative challenges to understand the subject more deeply. This level is likely to require 8 hours or more of study per week.\nFAQ\nWhen will the course run again?\nThe January 2015 session was the final version of the course. It will remain open so that those interested can register and access all the materials. All assignments are available to try but will not score or be eligible for a statement of accomplishment\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?\nStudents who complete the class during the originally scheduled session dates (that is, by 1st March 2015) will be offered a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors.\nDo I earn University of Edinburgh credits upon completion of this class?\nThe Statement of Accomplishment is not part of a formal qualification from the University. However, it may be useful to demonstrate prior learning and interest in your subject to a higher education institution or potential employer.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nNothing is required, but if you want to try out implementing some of the algorithms described in the lectures you'll need access to a programming environment. No specific programming language is required. Also, you may want to download existing planners and try those out. This may require you to compile them first.\nCan I contact the course lecturers directly?\nYou will appreciate that such direct contact would be difficult to manage. You are encouraged to use the course social network and discussion forum to raise questions and seek inputs. The tutors will participate in the forums, and will seek to answer frequently asked questions, in some cases by adding to the course FAQ area.\nWhat Twitter hash tag should I use?\nUse the hash tag #aiplan for tweets about the course.\nHow come this is free?\nWe are passionate about open on-line collaboration and education. Our taught AI planning course at Edinburgh has always published its course materials, readings and resources on-line for anyone to view. Our own on-campus students can access these materials at times when the course is not available if it is relevant to their interests and projects. We want to make the materials available in a more accessible form that can reach a broader audience who might be interested in AI planning technology. This achieves our primary objective of getting such technology into productive use. Another benefit for us is that more people get to know about courses in AI in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, or get interested in studying or collaborating with us."}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Analytical Chemistry / Instrumental Analysis", "cat": "4/chemistry", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 78, "desc": "If chemistry is the science of stuff, then analytical chemistry answers the question: what is it? And how much of it do you have? This course teaches how to do this with instrumental analysis! This course covers about a half a semester of instrumental analysis which is a standard part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples, blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what's in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.Syllabus\nDescription: This course will provide students with a background in modern analytical chemistry with an emphasis on instrumentation. Applications of instrumental analytical chemistry in medicine, forensics and materials science will be presented. Course objectives:To reinforce chemical principles central to analytical chemistry.To introduce instrumental techniques for chemical measurement.To develop critical thinking for interpreting analytical data.To select instrumentation appropriate to the measurement need.Week 1: Overview of instrumental analysis and basic chemistry review Week 2: Atomic spectroscopies and the analysis of metals Week 3: Calibration, QA/QC, and improving instrumental analysis Week 4: The basic principles of chromatography Week 5: Gas chromatography Week 6: Liquid chromatography Week 7: Vibrational spectroscopies Week 8: Electronic and optical sensorsRecommended Background\nYou should be familiar with freshman chemistry including balancing chemical\nequations, chemical equilibria, acid and base chemistry, stoichiometric\ncalculations, reduction and oxidation chemistry and interaction of light\nwith matter.Suggested Readings\nThis course is loosely based on Skoog, West, Holler and Crouch, Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry\n, 8th edition.&nbsp;Course Format\nThis class will consist of lecture videos, between 8 and 12 minutes in length. Most will include 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video; in addition, optional standalone quizzes will be provided to reinforce video lecture material and any additional reading. Not optional weekly problem sets will be the primary way to assess learning in the class. To develop critical thinking skills, three case studies will be provided throughout the class and the results will be assessed by course peers. A non-optional final problem set will evalaute integrated knowledge and retention of material. Every week there will be 6 to 8 short, usually less than 15 minutes, video lectures sometimes including interactive quizzes.&nbsp; In addition every week there will be a problem set, and 1 to 3 quizzes which cover the material in the lectures.&nbsp; Reading material will be provided each week from the web and to support the development of case studies.&nbsp;FAQ Will I get a certificate after completing this class? Rice University does award a certificate for completing this class and there will also be the opportunity for a certification with distinction. "}

Handheld systems, such as smartphones and tablets are now the most common way for people to access and interact with computing services. The demand for application development skills is therefore growing at a breathtaking pace. These skills, however, are multi-\u00ad\u2010 faceted, requiring students to master computer science and engineering principles, to learn the details of specific mobile application platforms, and to design artistic and engaging user interfaces that respond to how, where and why handheld applications are used.\nThis course will cover the fundamental programming principles, software architecture and user experience considerations underlying handheld software applications and their development environments. To bring these concepts alive, the course will involve in-\u00ad\u2010depth, hands-\u00ad\u2010on examples, implemented in the Android Platform, the fastest growing segment of the handheld system user base. Students will apply these teachings, also using the Android Platform, in laboratory projects and in a large-\u00ad\u2010scale semester project.&nbsp;\nNote: This course is part of a Coursera Specialization\nThis course and two others, led respectively by Drs. Douglas Schmidt and Jules White of Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other. Click here to find out more about the Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization. Therefore, some of the programming assignments and the course project for these courses will be coordinated. This course focuses on handheld systems and the design of user-facing applications, and will be taught first. The first Vanderbilt University course, Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems will focus on systems programming topics, such as middleware services and background processing. The second Vanderbilt University course, Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems will focus on connecting Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.Nevertheless, each of these courses stands alone. Students are not required to take all of them. Those who do, however, will gain a much more detailed, end-to-end&nbsp;understanding of handheld systems and their applications.Syllabus\nScheduleWeek #1:Objective: In this lesson, I discuss the Android Platform and the Android Development Environment. By the end of this lesson you should understand the components comprising the Android Platform and be able to use various tools found in the Android Development Environment\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecture #1 \u2013 The Android Platform\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecture #2 \u2013 The Android Development Environment\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab #1: Setup: Students identify required software &amp; install it on their personal computers.&nbsp; Students perform several tasks to familiarize themselves with the Android Platform and Development Environment.&nbsp;Week #2:Objective:&nbsp;In this lesson, I&nbsp;explain&nbsp;the basic components from which all Android applications are created. I also present the Activity class - one of the main class responsible for displaying an application's user interface. By the end of this&nbsp;lesson, you should recognize the four fundamental components of Android applications, be able to create a simple Android application and understand the lifecycle of the Activity class.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecture #3 \u2013 Application Fundamentals\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecture #4 \u2013 The Activity Class\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab #2 \u2013 The Activity Lifecycle &amp; Reconfiguration: Students build applications that trace the lifecycle callback methods issued by the Android platform and that demonstrate Android's behavior when the device configuration changes (e.g., when the device moves from portrait to landscape mode and back).Week #3:Objective:&nbsp;In this lesson, I&nbsp;explain the Intent class and Permissions. I also present the Fragment class - another key class responsible for displaying an application's user interface. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to&nbsp;create applications comprising more than one Activity, understand how to define and enforce permissions and be able to design applications that run on multiple, differently-sized devices.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecture #5 \u2013 The Intent Class\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecture #6 \u2013 Permissions\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecture #7 \u2013 The Fragment Class\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab #3a - Intents &amp; Permissions: &nbsp;Students build applications that require starting multiple Activities via both standard and custom Intents.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab #3b - Permissions: &nbsp;Students&nbsp;build applications that require standard and custom permissions.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab #3c \u2013 Multi-pane and single-pane User Interfaces:&nbsp;Students&nbsp;build an application that uses a single code base, but creates different user interfaces depending on a device's screen size.&nbsp;Week #4:&nbsp;Objective:&nbsp;In this lesson, I summarize and demonstrate the many class Android provides for creating user interfaces. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to define and deploy applications with sophisticated user interfaces.\u2022 Lectures #8 \u2013 User Interface Classes - Part I\u2022 Lectures #9 \u2013 User Interface Classes - Part II\u2022 Lab #4 \u2013 ToDoManager: &nbsp;Students build a ToDo list manager using the user interface elements discussed in lecture. The application allows users to create new ToDo Items and to display them in a ListView.&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;Mini-project - Modern Art User Interfaces: Students will build a complete app from scratch. Collaborators from the&nbsp;Musuem of Modern Art&nbsp;will help student draw some inspiration from the work of several Modern Art masters.Week #5:Objective:&nbsp;In this lesson, I dive deeper in Android, focusing on advanced some of the advanced capabilities it provides. I discuss using User Notifications to interact with the user, listening for and responding to events using the BroadcastReceiver class, and handling concurrency with Threads, AsyncTask &amp; Handlers. There are also two optional lectures dealing with using Alarms to run code at pre-scheduled times and with understanding how to access data over the network. By the end of this lesson, you should understand how these key technologies are used to support more advanced Android applications.\u2022 Lecture #10 \u2013 User Notifications\u2022 Lecture #11 \u2013 The BroadcastReceiver Class\u2022 Lecture #12 \u2013 Threads, AsyncTask &amp; Handlers\u2022 Lecture #13 - Alarms\u2022 Lecture #14 - Networking\u2022 Lab #5 \u2013 Tweet app: Students build an app that downloads and displays Tweet data. The app uses an AsyncTask for downloading data over the network. The app will also user BroadcastReceivers and User Notifications to apprise the user of the apps behavior and state.Week #6:Objective:&nbsp;In this lesson, I present a number of technologies related to presenting and interacting with dynamic content. This includes graphics and animation, handling touch input from the user, and recording and playing multimedia. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to animate your applications, create apps that respond to both standard and custom gestures, and display and use multimedia content.\u2022 Lecture #15 \u2013 Graphics &amp; Animation I\u2022 Lecture #16 \u2013 Graphics &amp; Animation II\u2022 Lecture #17 \u2013 Multi-touch &amp; Gestures\u2022 Lecture #18 \u2013 MultiMedia\u2022 Lab #6 - Bubble Popper: Students write an application to display and animate bubbles (graphics that look like bubbles) on the device's screen. When users touch the screen where a bubble is displayed, the bubble pops. The app will also accept gesture input, allowing the user to change the direction and speed of the bubble, using a fling gesture.Week #7:Objective:&nbsp;In this lesson, I go over the many sensors that now come standard on most mobile devices. I also provide a focused discussion of using sensors to capture location information and using maps to display that information. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to create context aware applications whose behavior changes based on environmental conditions.\u2022 Lecture #19 \u2013 Sensors\u2022 Lecture #20 \u2013 Location &amp; Maps\u2022 Lab #7 - Place Badge Collector: Students build an application that uses location information to collect Badges for the places they visit.Week #8:Objective:&nbsp;In this lesson, I wrap up with a discussion of some behind the scenes Android capabilities. I discuss how to manage structured data, how to share that data across applications using the ContentProvider class, and how to run operations in the background and across processes using the Service class.

This app will remind users to take a picture of themselves once a day. The app will collect and display the resulting set of photos.Recommended Background\nThis course is directed to Sophomore- or Junior-level undergraduate students. Students should already know how to program in Java, but are not expected to have studied mobile application development.&nbsp;If you don't already know Java, but&nbsp;have strong familiarity with other programming languages, you can improve your Java&nbsp;knowledge, by taking one of the many Java tutorials and online courses available on the web. As discussed above, this course assumes previous programming knowledge. It also assumes that you are willing to search for, read and learn from Android's developer documentation. Based on our previous experience, students who don't meet these criteria often end up being quite frustrated with the course.In short, this course is not designed&nbsp;for truly novice programmers. If your background is not appropriate for this class, consider&nbsp;first taking a less programming heavy&nbsp;introduction to Android such as, \"Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps\",&nbsp;by Lawrence Angrave of the University of Illinois and Urbana-Champaign.Suggested Readings\nThere is no textbook for this course, but I strongly encourage students to explore the wide range of freely-available Android-related resources.Keep up with changes and improvements in the Android ecosystem by reading the Android Developer's Blog.Watch tutorials and other presentations from the Google I/O conference.Course Format\nEach lesson will consist of video presentations, logically divided roughly into 5-10 minute sections. Throughout the lecture video there are ungraded \"in-video\" questions to help ensure that students are understanding the material. &nbsp;Each week there is also a short quiz containing questions/tasks to\nhelp ensure that the students have understood that week's lectures.&nbsp;The\nin-video questions are related to the current video section, and provide supplementary information, \u201cFood For\nThought\u201d discussion, and \"FLASHBACK\"\nquestions, which&nbsp;challenge the students to think about something we have discussed in a\nprevious lesson.\nEach week's videos will be accompanied by a lab\nexercise consisting of an assignment write-up, partially completed source code,\nand executable test cases. The students will run the test cases on their own\ncomputers to determine whether they've successfully completed the lab. For some labs, we will also require students to examine and grade the submissions of other students.Each lesson covers multiple Android source code examples. I strongly encourage students to&nbsp;download all the examples and to consult them both while&nbsp;watching the lecture and afterwards. The source code is publicly available on github:https://github.com/aporter/coursera-androidThe course will also have a complex final project.&nbsp;FAQ\nSome Frequently Asked Questions.&nbsp; What are the course objectives? Upon completing this course, students should be able to: Understand the Android platform's organization, patterns and programming mechanisms and be able to &nbsp;use them effectively to develop their own Android applications. Use development tools, such as those found in the Android Developer's Toolkit to efficiently create, understand, debug and optimize Android applications. Understand the key forces and constraints acting on handheld devices and know how to accommodate these when designing and building their own Android applications. Know where to find additional sources of information to understand and solve Android-related problems. Can students take this course if they have no prior experience with Android programming or programming with Java?&nbsp; This course assumes that students are comfortable programming in Java and have some experience programming Android apps. If you don't have any significant Java programming background, please look on the Internet for one of the many Java-related tutorials that are freely-available. When I try to watch the videos before the class start,&nbsp;I get an error message. You can preview some of the videos by pressing the \"Preview Lectures\" Button at the top of the course webpage Is the course broadcast live? I live on the other side of the world from you! No. Course lectures are videotaped. Students watch the lectures and do programming assignments and quizzes when it's convenient for them. What resources will I need for this class? For this course, you'll need is an Internet connection, a computer on which to run free Android developer tools, and the time to read, write, and discuss. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? How to write the software applications that you and half the world are running on your handheld devices. What computer languages do I need to know? Experience with Java should be enough. As mentioned in the Recommended Background Section, those who don't know Java, but have strong familiarity with other languages may want to take a Java tutorial prior to starting this course. Can students use programming language, other than Java, for the course? Not really. The main programming language for Android is Java. What should I be reading to prepare for class? There is no course textbook. If you want to get started early, dive into the Android Developer's Website Do I need to buy an Android device?&nbsp; No. All the graded exercises will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;using the Android Emulator.&nbsp; What is a \"trans-institution sequence of MOOCs?\"&nbsp; This MOOC course and another course tentatively called&nbsp;Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures for Concurrent and Networked Mobile Devices and Clouds, taught by Professors Doug Schmidt and Jules White of Vanderbilt University have been designed to complement each other. In particular, some of the programming assignments and the course project for both courses will be coordinated. The focus of Vanderbilt MOOCs will be systems programming topics, such as server-side Android concurrency, background processing, networking, and computing cloud integration, and will be taught starting in late March 2014. Additional information on our trans-institutional MOOC sequence is available&nbsp; here&nbsp;and&nbsp; here.&nbsp; Is it necessary to take all the courses in the sequence?&nbsp; No. If you just want to take some of the courses in this sequence--or take them all in different order--you're certainly welcome to do so, and you'll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the courses in this sequence in the order presented you'll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud. When will the course material be made available each week?&nbsp; All the course material (e.g., video lectures, quizzes, short essays, programming assignments, etc.), for each week will be made available at 12:00am eastern time (5am UTC/GMT). each Friday of the course. How does this MOOC compare/contrast with courses at the University of Maryland? This MOOC is heavily based on courses I teach at UMD, called CMSC436, Programming Handheld Systems. The course lecture material is similar, but the&nbsp;quizzes, programming assignments, and level of feedback for the UMD courses are more challenging, given that we have about twice the amount of time to work on it. Also, as the UMD course has many&nbsp;fewer students, there's&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;more personalized guidance from the professor and TAs that can't (yet) be replicated via a MOOC. This is one reason why it's important for students to take on some of the &nbsp;role of the Instructor. When we all work together, we all benefit. What is the most effective way to learn material covered in the course?&nbsp; I recommend watching the videos multiple times, looking for different levels of meaning in the diagrams and the examples. Likewise, I recommend reading outside sources of information. Naturally, participating in the online discussion forums (and ideally, a meetup group if one is available in your area) will help make the course material more engaging. Will you use Eclipse or Android Studio in this course?&nbsp; All of my videos use Eclipse as Android Studio is still in a pre-release state. If you're using a non-Eclipse development environment, such as AndroidStudio,&nbsp;you may need to enlist the help of other students on the online discussion forum. Which web browsers are recommended?&nbsp; Coursera recommends using the Chrome and Firefox browsers. There's also a&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;for Coursera MOOC, as well. Where can students download the slides that are presented in the videos?&nbsp; PDF versions of the slides will be available online as the videos are released.&nbsp; "}

We will focus on building the intuition and deep understanding of how the theory works, how to use it, and how to connect it to empirical facts. This first part builds the basic theoretical and empirical tools around some classic facts. The second part delves more deeply into applications and empirical evaluation. Are you curious about quantitative academic finance? Have you considered graduate study in finance? Are you working in an investment bank, money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta, risk premium, risk-neutral price, arbitrage, equity premium, and discount factor mean? This class is for you.&nbsp;We will see how one basic idea, price equals expected discounted payoff, unites everything - models that describe stocks, bonds, options, real investments, discrete time, continuous time, asset pricing, portfolio theory, and so forth.&nbsp;In this part I, we\u2019ll quickly learn or review time-series in continuous and discrete time. We'll look at some basic facts. Then we\u2019ll start with the underlying consumption-based model, and we\u2019ll preview some classic issues in finance. That outlines the big ideas of the whole class. Then, we'll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We'll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. We will study the classic linear models \u2014 CAPM, APT, ICAPM. We will learn how to use GMM to estimate and evaluate asset pricing models, as well as the classic regression tests. This paves the way for Part 2&nbsp;which focuses on applications and empirical evaluation.&nbsp;The math in real, academic, finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that's hard, and that's what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class.Syllabus\nPart 1 syllabus: Week 1: Stochastic Calculus Introduction and Review. dz, dt and all that.&nbsp;\nWeek 2: Introduction and Overview.

Here is the syllabus to whet your appetite:&nbsp;\nSpring break (1 week)\nWeek 1: Factor pricing models in action The Fama and French model Fund and performance evaluation.\nWeek 2: Time series predictability, volatilty and bubbles. Week 3: Equity premium, macroeconomics and asset pricing.\nWeek 4: Option Pricing.\nWeek 5: Term structure models and facts.\nWeek 6: Portfolio Theory.\nFinal ExamRecommended Background\nThis course uses concepts from finance, undergraduate applied mathematics, advanced undergraduate / beginning graduate level economics, and time-series econometrics. Students should be able to use single and multivariable calculus, simple differential equations, matrix algebra, and basic statistics. They should be able to program simple simulations in a matrix programming language like Matlab, Octave, R, Python, Julia, etc. Students should have some background in economics, including utility functions and maximization, and have worked with basic time-series econometrics, such as AR(1) models.Suggested Readings\nThe Preface and Chapter 1 of Asset Pricing&nbsp;(Princeton University Press) give a good feel for the class, the range of topics, and the mathematical level. The first two weeks of the class will be based on Chapter 1. We recommend purchasing the textbook to supplement your study in this class.Course Format\n\u2022 Reading assignments for each week, deriving the theory in detail and also giving intuition and applications. &nbsp;\u2022 Short lecture videos, emphaszing intuition and interpretation of the results rather than algebraic drudgery. The videos will incorporate integrated quiz questions.&nbsp;\u2022 Quizzes and weekly problem sets.&nbsp;\u2022 Forum discussions and regular Google hangouts.&nbsp;\u2022 A final exam.FAQ\nWill I need to purchase anything to succeed in this course?We recommend purchasing the textbook Asset Pricing, but you can complete the class without it. It is possible to rent the ebook version of Asset Pricing for about $20. Some of the readings will require a free myJSTOR account (see jstor.org for more information).What resources will I need for this class?Time, a computer with a good internet connection, some programming language, and curiosity.&nbsp;Do I need to be a finance professional to benefit from this class?No. The course is directed at doing and understanding academic research. It's useful if you want to do research in asset pricing, either in academia or industry, that recognizes a balance between risk and return. &nbsp;Do I need a background in finance?You should know what a stock and bond are, but an extensive knowledge of finance is not necessary. Those who bring previous experience will&nbsp;enjoy seeing familiar concepts united and brought to a deeper level. Please see the section on Recommended Background above for information on the mathematical and economic prerequisites of the class."}

Please note, this course is open now - find it&nbsp;here.&nbsp;Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks wondered if there were other worlds in the cosmos. This question is now being experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh,&nbsp;is an introduction to astrobiology and was the first MOOC to explore this subject. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere. Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry. In this course we will explore what we know about life\u2019s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields.Syllabus\nWeek 1: What is life and what are the definitions of life? What do we know about the origin of life and what are the current hypotheses for how it originated on the Earth?\u00a0\nWeek 2: What was the environment of early Earth like when life first emerged and what do we know about life on the earliest Earth? How did life evolve to cope with survival in extreme environments? What have been the major evolutionary transitions of life on the Earth?\nWeek 3: What are the prospects for life on other planetary bodies in our Solar System and how do we go about searching for it? What conditions are required for a planet to be habitable?\nWeek 4: How do we search for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars and how would we detect life on them?\nWeek 5: What are the possibilities for intelligent life elsewhere?

{"lang": "en", "name": "Automata", "cat": "5/computer_science", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 92, "desc": "This course covers finite automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines, undecidable problems, and intractable problems (NP-completeness). I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Participants have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.\nThe course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.Why Study Automata Theory?This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than \"push this button.\"The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach \u2014 simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Finite AutomataWeek 2: Regular Expressions and Properties of Regular LanguagesWeek 3: Context-Free Grammars and LanguagesWeek 4: Properties of Context-Free Languages, plus introduction to Turing MachinesWeek 5: Turing Machines and UndecidabilityWeek 6: Intractable Problems (NP-Completeness)Recommended Background\nYou should have had a second course in Computer Science \u2014 one that covers basic data structures (e.g., lists, trees, hashing), and basic algorithms (e.g., tree traversals, recursive programming, big-oh running time). In addition, a course in discrete mathematics covering propositional logic, graphs, and inductive proofs is valuable background.\nIf you need to review or learn some of these topics, there is a free on-line textbook Foundations of Computer Science, written by Al Aho and me, available at\u00a0http://i.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html. Recommended chapters include 2 (Recursion and Induction), 3 (Running Time of Programs), 5 (Trees), 6 (Lists), 7 (Sets), 9 (Graphs), and 12 (Propositional Logic). You will also find introductions to finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars in Chapters 10 and 11. Reading Chapter 10 would be good preparation for the first week of the course.\nThe course includes two programming exercises for which a knowledge of Java or Python\u00a0is required. However, these exercises are optional. You will receive automated feedback, but the results will not be recorded or used to grade the course. So if you are familiar with neither\u00a0Java nor Python, you can still take the course without concern for prerequisites.Suggested Readings\nThe course is built around the material in Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation 3rd edition (2007), by John Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, and Jeffrey Ullman, Addison-Wesley. However, you do not have to buy a copy of this book. The course is self-contained, and all homeworks and exams are based solely on concepts taught in the video lectures.Course Format\n3-4 lecture videos each week. \u00a0Many of these videos are longer than the typical MOOC video, so feel free to pause them and view them in several sessions of your own choice.There will be 1-2 problem sets each week, which together count for 50% of the marks. \u00a0You can repeat them until you get them all correct, and they are due two Mondays after release of the videos on which they are based.There are also two optional programming challenges.FAQ\nWill I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes. Participants who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nWhat is the format of the class?\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 15 and 45 minutes in length. These contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures, optional programming assignments, and a (not optional) final exam.\nHow much work will I be expected to do in this class?\nYou need to work about 5-10 hours per week to complete the course. About 2 hours of video segments each week, containing inline ungraded quiz questions. A weekly, graded multiple choice homework.\n"}

The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the maturity of Abbey Road. While the focus will be on the music, we will also consider how recording techniques, the music business, the music of other artists, and the culture of the 1960s affected John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they created the Beatles repertory.There is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band's biography, several insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding the band. This course will try to synthesize much of that information into an account of the Beatles' development as musicians and songwriters.Syllabus\nWeek One: Early days and success in the UK. The Beatles as pop craftsmen. Study of cover versions at Cavern and Hamburg shows, Please Please Me, With the Beatles, and the singles from this period.Week Two: Success in America and the world. The Beatles begin to move toward the artist model. Music from \u00a0A Hard Day's Night, Beatles For Sale, and singles from this period. From this point on we will closely follow particular authorship of songs, keeping track of John, Paul, and George as individual songwriters.Week Three: Pop maturity. Increased experimentation, still mostly within the context of the pop single. The increasingly important role of the recording studio and recording techniques and innovations. Help!,\u00a0Rubber Soul,\u00a0and singles from this period.Week Four: Psychedelia. The artist model comes into full bloom. The rise of importance of the album and idea-driven projects. Revolver, \"Penny Lane,\" \"Strawberry Fields,\" Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and other singles from this period, including the tracks that would end up on Yellow Submarine.Week Five: A co-op of singer-songwriters. The White Album both begins a return to roots while also continuing the musical experimentation of the earlier music, but now each song is less of a group effort. Creative differences arise. \u00a0The White Album and singles from this period.Week Six: Once there was a way to get back home. The Get Back sessions embrace a return-to-simplicy approach but are aborted. Abbey Road attempts to get back to the band's previous manner of working. Let It Be combines material from Get Back with newly recorded tracks. Abbey Road, Let It Be, and singles from this period.Recommended Background\nNo previous musical training is required. The ability to read music is not required.Suggested Readings\nPrimary reference:William J. Dowlding, Beatlesongs, Touchstone, 1989. A great one-volume account of all the Beatles albums and singles, organized chronologically and in running order, providing song info and Beatle comments. A perfect place to start.Additional references:The Beatles Anthology (5-DVD set), Apple, 1995. The Beatles story told as by the band. It is interesting to compare the story as they tell it with the many other band biographies that are out there. There is also a book that provides the full interviews from this project, and this is an excellent resource as well. Other insider accounts are provided by George Martin, Geoff Emerick, Geoffrey Ellis, and Peter Brown, as well as by Brian Epstein in his autobiography (ghost written by Derek Taylor).Walter Everett, The Beatles As Musicians (two volumes), Oxford University Press, 1999 and 2001. Without question the best books on the technical aspects of the Beatles music available. Highly recommended, especially for those with music training.Mark Lewissohn, The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Sterling, 2013. After years of being out of print, this excellent book on the details of Beatles recording sessions is due to be published in an inexpensive paperback version in October 2013.Andy Babiuk, Beatles Gear, Backbeat, 2009. For the gearheads out there, this book gives you all the details you need on the guitars, amps, drums, and other gear the band used in the 1960s.The Beatles Complete Scores, Hal Leonard, 1993. While no knowledge of musical notation is required for this course, if you can read music this is a great resource. This volume transcribes every track recorded by the band and presents it in score format. There are errors, but overall this is a crucial resource for those interested in the technical details of the music.Course Format\nThe course will consist of several lecture videos each week; each video will be approximately 10-12 minutes in length, 90 minutes total. Students will be expected to find the music discussed in the lectures, as copyright laws prohibit us from playing music during the lectures. Students are also encouraged to seek out the recommended texts and supplementary materials and read or view the parallel information provided there as we move through the band's career week by week.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.What resources will I need for this class?\nFor this course, all you need is an Internet connection, a willingness to seek out the music, and the time to view the lectures, listen to the music, and discuss the Beatles in the online forum.I have never studied music before. \u00a0Can I still take this course?\nYes, absolutely. While there will be musical details discussed, much of the information provided in this course is meant for the general student. Lack of musical training should not impact your ability to perform well on the quizzes.\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nStudying the music of the Beatles is not only a great way to get to know music you love much more intimately, but it also opens up new ways of listening to and thinking about all the music you care about."}

Each lecture will explore a different facet of the music; all will attempt to locate the source of the tremendous psychological power of Beethoven\u2019s music. Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For\nmany musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,\nrigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled\nin the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to\nperformers. At the same time, Beethoven\u2019s music is casually familiar to\nmillions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically\ninclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,\nyet still represents its summit.\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas\nfrom the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata\nand an aspect of Beethoven\u2019s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the\nrelationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the\ncritical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of\nextremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in\nwhich the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the\ncharacter of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis\nand historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a\nmusicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the\nperformer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven\u2019s music\nitself.Exploring Beethoven's Piano Sonatas is scheduled to reopen in January 2015, with new material added in Spring 2015. Join the watchlist to be notified as soon as registration begins.This season's Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson.\nSyllabus\nWeek One: How Things Were Week Two: The First 13\nSonata No. 4 in E-flat major, Op. 7 Week Three: New Paths\nSonata No. 12 in A-flat major, Op. 26\nSonata No. 13 in E-flat major, Op. 27, No. 1 (\u201cSonata quasi una fantasia\u201d)\nSonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 2 (\u201cMoonlight\u201d)\nSonata No. 15 in D major, Op. 28 (\u201cPastoral\u201d) Week Four: Crisis\nSonata No. 16 in G major, Op. 31, No. 1\nSonata No. 24 in F-sharp major, Op. 78&nbsp;\nSonata No. 26 in E-flat major, Op. 81a (\u201cLes adieux\u201d or \"Lebewohl\")\nFantasy, Op. 77 Week Five: Towards Infinity\nSonata No. 30 in E major, Op. 109\nSonata No. 5 in C minor, Op. 10, No. 1Recommended Background\nIt is not necessary to have studied an instrument to take this course, or to have any knowledge of music theory. While these may enhance your experience of the course, it is designed for students of all backgrounds with a desire to learn more about Beethoven and his world.Suggested Readings\nThere are no pre-requisites for this course. For those who would like to explore the subject from a different perspective, though, there are several terrific studies of Beethoven: [Alexander] Thayer\u2019s Life of\nBeethoven, in two extensive volumes, still, after well over a century, sets the standard for all Beethoven biographies. It is thorough and sober-minded without being dry. It is not the work of a musician, but as a look at the man\u2019s life, it is unmatched. Edited by Elliot Forbes, it is available from the Princeton University Press. Lewis Lockwood\u2019s Beethoven: The Music and the Life, published in 2005 by Norton, is very different and no less valuable. Far less exhaustive on Beethoven\u2019s biography than Thayer, Lockwood focuses on Beethoven\u2019s musical development, of which he gives a beautiful account \u2013 scholarly, but definitely readable by a non-musician. Beethoven\u2019s own letters are extremely revealing, and often very touching. Beethoven\u2019s mix of pride, stubbornness, and generosity is constantly on display, just as it is in the music. Dover has a collection of 457 of the letters, which touch on matters both mundane (fees for compositions; details of publications) and excruciating (his deafness; his tragic relationship with his nephew). On a more musicological level, I cannot recommend Charles Rosen\u2019s works highly enough. Those without any musical background will probably find them very thorny. But for anyone who has studied music, both The Classical Style and Sonata Forms (Norton, again) are works of art. The former has a chapter devoted to Beethoven, but really, every word of both books manages to explain how the music of the period works \u2013 not merely in an academic manner, but in a way that comes as close to explaining the psychological power of this music as one can in words. Again, not essential as background for the course, but enthusiastically recommended for anyone who wants to go deeper into these pieces.\nOf course, the best way to explore Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas is to listen to them. There are countless great recordings of these works; the complete cycles that I grew up with are those of Artur Schnabel (EMI) and Richard Goode (Nonesuch). They are products of two very different eras, and therefore they collectively form a document of the relationship great musicians have had with Beethoven over the past 100 years.\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I have written about Beethoven previously, on my website and as a Kindle Single. These writings are not specifically connected to the content of the course; they are more about my own personal relationship with Beethoven and his psychological effect on me, as a performer.&nbsp;I am also in the midst of recording the sonatas; the three volumes already released are available from Onyx Classics.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?Yes.

More than 80% of matter in the Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen\ninto the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the Universe started acceleration\nabout 7 billion years ago and the Universe is being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy multiplying in vacuum.

How do these things work? This course presents fundamental principles, described quantitatively. In this class you will learn how to think about electrically active\ntissue in terms of individual mechanisms, and you will learn to analyze the\nmechanisms quantitatively as well as describe them qualitatively. &nbsp;The\ncourse uses many of the same examples used by Hodgkin and Huxley, who won the\nNobel Prize for their experimental unraveling of the mechanisms of the nerve\naxon of the giant squid, and their creation of a mathematical model of\nmembranes and propagation to understand its function. &nbsp;That work has been\nthe foundational element of most subsequent understandings of electrically\nactive tissue, whether in nerves, the brain or in muscle, including the heart. In this course, topics include:\nThe electrical charging of active membranes from the creation and use of differences in ionic concentrations across the membrane.\nThe stimulation of the membrane, both naturally and from engineered sources.\nThe creation of action potentials by the membrane in response to stimulation.\nThe chain reaction of membrane responses, with each small region or cell initiating an action potential in adjacent ones.\nThe observation of associated electrical currents in terms of extracellular wave voltages they create, the basis of clinical measurements such as the electrocardiogram.\nThe course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion, which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis, you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.\nSyllabus\nThe topics addressed in the course will include:\nElectricity in living tissue, \u201canimal electricity,\" Galvani and Volta\n&nbsp;Voltages, currents and sources in solutions. &nbsp;\nElectrically active membranes and their resistance and capacitance\nDiffusion and fields across membranes, Nernst equilibrium\nIon channels\nAction potentials\nImpulse propagation, current along the fiber\n&nbsp;Electrical stimulation\nExtracellular fields &nbsp;1,2\nExtracellular wave forms\nTransmembrane stimulation\n&nbsp;Field stimulation\nThe goal of the course is to understand an integrated system. That requires understanding the components individually, but the challenge is to understand them working together as an integrated whole.Recommended Background\nInsofar as\nBioelectricity, this course begins at the beginning, so all the main ideas can\nbe understood without prerequisite courses. &nbsp;As electricity is invisible,\nno one sees it, so the most important prerequisite is one\u2019s willingness to\nbring imagination, reflection and patience to the topics, so as to allow the\nideas to grow and knit together in one\u2019s own mind. Some of the\npresentation uses equations and other mathematics that come from calculus and\ndifferential equations and other parts reason from the physics of electricity\nand the analysis of circuits, so background knowledge about these subjects is\nhelpful. For example, one needs to recognize that dV/dt is the rate of change\nof voltage V with time t, so as to understand that C dV/dt is the current\nthrough a capacitor C.&nbsp; As another example, if V=1/r, what is dV/dr?\nA course\nlike this one usually is given to advanced undergraduates or early graduate\nstudents in science and engineering, as these students have taken calculus and\nphysics, and differential equations and circuits, and thus are comfortable when\nnotation or simple operations from these fields are used.Suggested Readings\nReference text (not required): Bioelectricity: A Quantitative ApproachCourse Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are\nabout 10 minutes in length. Some videos will present new concepts, while others\nwill show numerical calculations using concepts already presented, a kind of\nvideo problem session.&nbsp; Each week\nthere will be two quizzes.&nbsp; Quiz A,\nmostly multiple choice, is about core concepts.&nbsp;\nQuiz B is more advanced.&nbsp; Quiz B questions\noften ask for calculations involving formulas or numbers, but occasionally ask\nfor a short computer program or a brief essay. &nbsp;At the end of the course, there are two parts\nof the final exam, similarly divided into A (qualitative) and B (quantitative)\nsets.&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will\nreceive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. A statement of accomplishment reflecting qualitative accomplishment is given on the basis of quiz A and exam A responses alone. A higher-level statement of accomplishment is given based on combined A (qualitative) and B (quantitative) scores.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nYou should have access to a computer to put numbers into equations and get numerical results.\nDoes the class require computer programming?\nThere are no complex programming assignments, but there are relatively simple ones within questions in the B quizzes. Some calculations have to be performed cyclically for a few dozen cycles, so one has to be able to write programs that can accomplish such repetition. Examples are given with C++ or Python statements. Will I learn how to perform medical tests such as taking an ECG, and will I learn how these are interpreted?\nNo. However, you will learn some fundamentals about what is measured, and where it comes from.\nDoes this course include presentation and use of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for nerves?\nYes, as these equations are the foundation for most present-day understanding of electrically excitable membrane. They also illustrate how greatly biology, sometimes considered limited to qualitative descriptions, has become a precise, quantitative subject.\nIs this class hard?\nNo and yes. In this class about a dozen basic ideas are put together into combinations that produce remarkable outcomes. No, it is not a subject where any one idea or any one step is especially difficult. Yes, it is a subject (and thus a class) that requires reflection and assembly into your own mind of how these ideas relate to each other in combination. As in gardening, you cannot make these ideas grow: you have to plant them with care and let them grow.\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nHow a battery can be in salt water for 100 years, used over and over, and yet never discharge.\n"}

It has now been split into three smaller courses. The sequencing of the&nbsp;human genome fueled a computational revolution in biology. As a result, modern biology produces as many new&nbsp;algorithms as any other fundamental realm of&nbsp;science. &nbsp;Accordingly, the newly formed&nbsp;links between computer science and biology affect the way we teach applied algorithms to computer scientists.This course has now been split into three smaller pieces:Finding Hidden Messages in DNA: This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat. After warming up our algorithmic muscles, we will learn how randomized algorithms can be used to solve problems in bioinformatics.Assembling Genomes and Sequencing Antibiotics: Biologists still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome or the amino acids of an antibiotic as you would read a book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA and weigh small antibiotic fragments. In this course, we will see how graph theory and brute force algorithms can be used to reconstruct genomes and antibiotics.Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes: After sequencing genomes, we would like to compare them. We will see that dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic tool when we compare two genes or two proteins. When we \"zoom out\" to compare entire genomes, we will employ combinatorial algorithms.\nEach course parallels two chapters from a&nbsp;textbook covering a single biological question and slowly builds the algorithmic knowledge required to address this challenge. &nbsp;Along the way, coding challenges and exercises (many of which ask you to apply your skills to real&nbsp;genetic data) will be directly integrated into the text at the exact moment they are needed.Syllabus\nThe course was based on six \"chapters\" covering the following central questions, with the algorithmic ideas that we will use to solve them in parentheses:Where Does DNA Replication Begin? (Algorithmic Warm-up)How Do We Sequence Antibiotics? (Brute Force Algorithms)Which DNA Patterns Act As Cellular Clocks? (Greedy and Randomized Algorithms)How Do We Assemble Genomes? (Graph Algorithms)How Do We Compare Biological Sequences? (Dynamic Programming Algorithms)Are There Fragile Regions in the Human Genome? (Combinatorial Algorithms)Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 2) is based around the following questions:&nbsp;Which Animal Gave Us SARS? (Evolutionary Trees)How Do We Locate Disease-Causing Mutations? (Combinatorial Pattern Matching)How Did Yeast Become Such a Good Wine Brewer? (Clustering Algorithms)Why Do We Still Not Have an HIV Vaccine? (Hldden Markov Models)Was T-Rex Just a Big Chicken?

Even though the courses have been split, the overall content remains the same, so we feel confident that we're maintaining learning standards of our material.Q: What if I earned a voucher for retaking this course? Can I use it in the new courses?Vouchers from the older course will be valid for the newer courses. If you took the original course and earned a voucher, you will&nbsp;be&nbsp;issued a voucher for this course as well as for \"Assembling Genomes and Sequencing Antibiotics\" and \"Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes\" &nbsp;(three vouchers total).Q: Does this mean that the overall cost for earning Verified Certificates is greater now?Yes. Since there are more courses now, the overall cost for Verified Certificates is greater than before.

Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and a clear, dynamic, unified approach.\nTHE SIGNATURE TRACK OPTION\nSignature Track is an optional path you may choose for this course. By signing up and paying a nominal fee (financial aid can be provided), you can add a higher level of identity verification to your Coursera coursework. If you achieve the threshold score, you have the opportunity to earn a Verified Certificate issued jointly by Penn and Coursera. For each assignment, your identity is confirmed through your photo and unique typing pattern. If you earn a Verified Certificate, you will also be given a personal URL through which your course records can be shared with employers and educational institutions.\nTHE COLLEGE CREDIT RECOMMENDATION OPTION\nNote: The following only applies to sessions starting on September 8th, 2014, and prior. This Calculus course has been evaluated and recommended by the American Council on Education\u2019s College Credit Recommendation Service (ACE CREDIT) for college credit so you can get a head start on your college education. More than 2,000 higher education institutions consider ACE credit recommendations for transfer to degree programs. If you add this option to sessions starting on or prior to September 8th, 2014, towards the end of the course, you will take an online proctored exam which will be combined with your coursework to determine your eligibility for college credit recommendation.Syllabus\nThe course is divided into five \"chapters\":\nCHAPTER 1: Functions\nAfter a brief review of the basics, we will dive into Taylor series as a way of working with and approximating complicated functions. The chapter will use a series-based approach to understanding limits and asymptotics.\nCHAPTER 2: Differentiation\nThough you already know how to differentiate some functions, you may not know what differentiation means. This chapter will emphasize conceptual understanding and applications of derivatives.\nCHAPTER 3: Integration\nWe will use the indefinite integral (an anti-derivative) as a motivation to look at differential equations in applications ranging from population models to linguistics to coupled oscillators. Techniques of integration up to and including computer-assisted\nmethods will lead to Riemann sums and the definite integral.\nCHAPTER 4: Applications\nWe will get busy in this chapter with applications of the definite integral to problems in geometry, physics, economics, biology, probability,&nbsp;and more. You will learn how to solve a wide array of problems using a consistent conceptual approach.\nCHAPTER 5: Discretization\nHaving covered Calculus for functions with a single real input and a single real output, we turn to functions with a discrete input and a real output: sequences. We will re-develop all of Calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals, differential equations)\nin this new context, and return to the beginning of the course with a deeper consideration of Taylor series.\nRecommended Background\nStudents are expected to have prior exposure to Calculus at the high-school (e.g., AP Calculus AB)&nbsp;level. It will be assumed that students: are familiar with transcendental functions (exp, ln, sin, cos, tan, etc.); are able to compute very simple limits, derivatives, and integrals; have seen slope and area interpretations of derivatives and integrals respectively. This material will be reviewed; however, it is important to begin the course with some background. A diagnostic exam will be made available to help you gauge your preparedness.&nbsp;\nThe course will serve equally well as a first university-level course in Calculus or as a review from a novel perspective.\nIf you've never seen Calculus before, this is likely not the course for you. Please see, e.g., the more introductory course from Ohio State University:&nbsp; https://www.coursera.org/course/calc1\nIf you are looking for the background needed to begin a study of Calculus, please see, e.g., the pre-Calculus course by UC Irvine:&nbsp;https://www.coursera.org/course/precalculus\nSuggested Readings\nThere is a fun picture-book available that gives the main ideas of the course:\nR. Ghrist [2012],\nFLCT: the Funny Little Calculus Text\nYou can preview the entire book for free or download a copy&nbsp;through&nbsp;\ngoogle play. This is a supplemental text only and is not required for the course...but it might make you laugh.Course Format\nThe class will consist of nearly 60 animated&nbsp;lecture videos, each about 15 minutes in length. The schedule will be approximately 5 quarter-hour lectures per week over 13 weeks. Occasional \"bonus\" lectures will provide more advanced or off-the-syllabus\nperspectives. You will get to practice your skills with lots of homework problems. These will not count towards your grade for the course, but, because of this, there will be open forums for discussing how to solve the homework problems.&nbsp;Grading\nwill be based on graded chapter quizzes (5),&nbsp;and a final exam.FAQ Will I get some kind of&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of&nbsp;Accomplishment&nbsp;signed by the instructor. If you sign up for the \"Signature Track\", then you have the opportunity to earn a verified Certificate. What is the format of the class? The class will consist of lecture videos, usually about fifteen minutes each. There will be homework problems that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately seventy-five minutes worth of video content per week. The lectures are fairly dense: you will want to budget enough time to allow for repeated viewings, especially when working through the homework assignments. Will the text of the lectures be available? We are building a detailed course wiki which mirrors the lectures closely; also, the videos will have subtitles. In other words, you do not need to take detailed notes of the lecture -- it's already been done for you. Is this a hard course? Yes. Let me repeat: YES. This course is a faithful representation of the depth and difficulty of Penn's MATH 104, a course that many of our best students find to be a challenge. Calculus, like the rest of Mathematics, takes time and effort to master. If you are prepared to work hard at the assignments, I'll work hard to explain the principles as clearly as possible. Do I need a graphing calculator or special mathematical software? No! This course will emphasize conceptual understanding and applications. All the computations should be done using a pencil, eraser, paper, and your brain, though not necessarily in that order of importance.Does this course cover all of Calculus?No. It will be assumed that you've seen some of the subject, at a high-school equivalent level (e.g., at the level of the Calculus AB exam). In addition, we will cover only single-variable calculus, not multi-variable. How do I connect with this course on social media?You can join Calculus: Single Variable's student community&nbsp;on Facebook, follow the course on Twitter, or add it on Google+ to connect with your fellow classmates outside of the discussion boards.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For more information on Penn\u2019s Open Learning initiative, please go to:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://openlearning.upenn.edu"}

The approach we develop is critical: we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it. Qui \u00e9tait Jean Calvin\u00a0? Pourquoi ses id\u00e9es ont-elles exerc\u00e9 une telle\ninfluence au 16e si\u00e8cle et dans les si\u00e8cles suivants\u00a0? Ce cours cherchera\n\u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces deux questions.\nIl mettra en \u00e9vidence l\u2019humanisme de Calvin, sa compr\u00e9hension de la pens\u00e9e\nbiblique, son acuit\u00e9 th\u00e9ologique, son sens aigu des probl\u00e8mes sociaux et\npolitiques.

Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century\nand well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions.\nWe will present his humanistic leanings, his interpretation of the Bible,\nhis theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions.\nWe will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shaping\nFrench language, his understanding of the human before God and in society.\nThe course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva\ninto an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning of\nwork and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions\n(the \u00ab\u00a0Company of Pastors\u00a0\u00bb, the \u00ab\u00a0Consistory\u00a0\u00bb and\nthe \u00ab\u00a0Academy\u00a0\u00bb).\nThe course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration,\nor rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel\nServet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed\nin Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvin\u2019s theology, we will show both\nhis lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom\none may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance\nhis doctrine of predestination).\nTowards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attention\nto the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces,\nEngland) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa and\nAsia).\nCourse in French with English subtitles.Syllabus\nSemaine 1 : La vie de Calvin / Week 1 : Calvin's lifeSemaine 2 : La pens\u00e9e de Calvin / Week 2 : Calvin's thoughtSemaine 3 : L'\u00e9thique de Calvin / Week 3 : Calvin's ethicsSemaine 4 : La diffusion du calvinisme / Week 4 : The spread of CalvinismSemaine 5 : Lire Calvin aujourd'hui\u00a0 / Week 5 : Reading Calvin todayRecommended Background\nAucune formation pr\u00e9alable n'est requise.\n---\nThere are no prerequisites for this course.Suggested Readings\nLa consultation des ouvrages suivants est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e /\u00a0 The following books are useful : Fran\u00e7ois Wendel, Calvin.

In this course we look at causal effects as opposed to spurious relationships. We will discuss how they can be identified in the social sciences using quantitative data, and describe how this can help us understand social mechanisms. In this course\nwe discuss how to identify causal effect in the social sciences. Causal effects\nare interesting whenever we want to understand mechanisms. As\nan example we can think of the case of wage differentials across gender. This\nmay be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobserved\nbackground characteristics across gender. Usually we would like to think about\ndiscrimination as a mechanism whereas differences in background characteristics\nwould usually not been seen as a mechanism. So it may be important to be able\nto tell why there is pay differences across gender. To show\ncausal effects the provision of a statistical relationship is not enough.&nbsp; The fundamental problem in identifying causal\neffects is therefore a matter of research design and research strategy. During the course we will\nexamine such research designs and strategies and look at the relevance of different assumptions behind these\nmethods. The course also addresses the benefits of experimental data and introduces several new statistical and econometrical methods designed to improve causal statements from\nnon-experimental and observational data.Syllabus\nModule 1 - The nature of causal effects and how to measure them\nModule 2 - The multivariate regression model and mediating factors\nModule 3 - Randomized controlled trials\nModule 4 - Instrumental variables\nModule 5 - Difference in differenceRecommended Background\nThis is a graduate level course, for people who already have some experience with statistics and familiarity with causal inference and social sciences. Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has some excellent statistics courses in their Data Science Specialization here on Coursera. Especially the course on R Programming can be helpful for learners with no prior knowledge of this language.Suggested Readings\nDuring the course learners are expected to read roughly 100 pages from The World Bank's Handbook on Impact Evaluation Quantitative Methods and Practices.For each module there are also a number of suggested readings that can be helpful. All readings, mandatory and suggested, are open access. Course Format\nThe course consists of five modules, each with video lectures, readings and quizzes. FAQ\nWill I get a Statement/Certificate after completing this class?Yes. Course participants who successfully complete the course will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by Professor Anders Holm.\nThe course is also offered on Signature Track. This makes it possible for you to earn a so-called Verified Certificate.

The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) offer the opportunity for educators to transform teaching and learning by positioning students in more active roles as learners. In addition to explicit content standards (which describe what students will know), the CCSSM present a broad range of practice standards that describe ways that successful students in math demonstrate proficiency.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Children Acquiring Literacy Naturally", "cat": "8/engineering_technology|9/humanities|14/social_sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 118, "desc": "This course will survey fundamental principles of language acquisition and learning to read. We will explore the possibility of becoming literate without formal schooling and instruction. No prior background in behavioral science, neuroscience, or technology is required. Have recent developments in behavioral\nscience, neuroscience, and technology made it possible&nbsp;to achieve universal literacy with minimal cost? This course explores that important question.&nbsp;The lectures contemplate a revolutionary\nnew age that challenges the survival of our educational institutions and\nsociety as we know them. Learn about current research and theory in language\nacquisition, reading pedagogy, and wearable computing to assess the possibility\nof an interactive system that would enable infants, toddlers, and preschool children to\nacquire literacy naturally.Syllabus\nLecture 1: &nbsp;The course&nbsp;begins with the guiding proposal that universal\nliteracy can be achieved with minimal cost. It questions the commonly held belief that written language requires\nformal instruction and schooling whereas spoken language is seamlessly acquired\nfrom birth onward by natural interactions with persons who talk. This proposal\nis followed by an overview of the scientific process because the research and\ntheory discussed in the class will consist of alternative perspectives and the\nstudents will learn how different perspectives are developed and evaluated.\nThis process will enhance their critical thinking skills.\nLecture 2: There have been two primary theoretical\nframeworks to describe language and its acquisition. The nativist position\nholds that language and its acquisition are uniquely dependent on a considerable\namount of innate abilities, and unlike other perceptual and cognitive\nfunctions. The empiricist position holds that very little, if any, of language\ndepends on innate abilities and its acquisition can be accounted for by typical\nperceptual and cognitive processes. To evaluate these two theoretical\nframeworks, we will learn about language structure, how it is used, and how it\nis acquired.\nLectures 3 and 4: To set the stage for assessing the\npossibility of naturally acquired reading, we will explore speech perception\nand how it is acquired. Speech has also had two alternative theoretical\nframeworks, and we will consider relevant research that addresses their\ndifferences. The goal of this assessment is to better understand what is\nrequired for speech perception and its acquisition and how these requirements\ncompare to the natural acquisition of reading.\nLectures 5 and 6: These lectures will give an overview of\nresearch and theory on reading and literacy. Given the possibility of naturally\nacquired reading, we will review the nature of reading and how it is currently\ntaught. One of the main goals is to destroy prevalent myths about how we read.\nThis discussion will highlight the assumptions in current practice and how they\ncompare to the possibility of naturally acquired reading.\nLecture 7: As covered in the previous lectures, it is\ncommonly believed that spoken and signed languages are acquired from birth\nonward by natural interactions with persons who talk whereas learning to read\nrequires formal instruction and schooling. We consider the hypothesis that once\nan appropriate form of written text is made available early in a child\u2019s life\nbefore formal schooling begins, reading will also be learned inductively,\nemerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. We will\nexamine the role of perception and action modalities in language acquisition\nand use and compare spoken and signed languages to written languages.\nLecture 8: We will describe the demographics of literacy and\nilliteracy and their social and economic implications. The cost of illiteracy\nas well as the huge cost of formal literacy instruction is one of the major\nfinancial burdens on societies.\nLecture 9: We will study the implications of naturally\nacquired literacy for individuals who are spoken and/or written language\nchallenged because of deafness or other impairments.\nLecture 10. We will review past technological developments\nto set the stage for peering into the future.

Eating patterns that begin in childhood affect health and wellbeing across\nthe lifespan. In the USA, we are in the midst of a childhood obesity epidemic\nthat threatens to leave our children with a shorter life expectancy than\ntheir parents. As processed foods become more readily available around\nthe world, other developed nations are beginning to follow suit. This course\nexamines contemporary child nutrition in America from the individual decisions\nmade by each family to the widespread food marketing targeting our children.\n\u00a0The health risks associated with obesity in childhood are also discussed.\nStudents will learn what constitutes a healthy diet for children and adults\nand how to prepare simple, delicious foods aimed at inspiring a lifelong\ncelebration of easy home-cooked meals. This course will help prepare students\nto be the leading health providers, teachers and parents of the present\nand future.Syllabus\nWeek one: Introduction to the problem - the childhood obesity epidemic facing the USA in particular and many developed nations who are following suit. Why should we care and what can be done? What are the current recommendations, how have they changed and how well are we doing in meeting our children's dietary needs? Cooking also starts this week with how to make a simple breakfast and a stir-fry. We also explore the six basic ingredients every cook should have on hand! Week two: What constitutes a balanced meal? What are carbohydrates, fats and proteins and how do we choose the healthiest of these? What is a glycemic index? Learn tricks for controlling portion sizes while maintaining satisfaction; cooking continues with more healthy breakfast alternatives, an easy dinner all in one dish, and a simple, (gluten-free) cake for special occasions. Week three: How to pack a quick, healthy lunch for a child and why this is so important; how to shop for fruits and vegetables and navigate the supermarket for better health; what are the benefits of the family meal? How can we \"make over\" our children's favorite foods, and help them enjoy healthier treats?\u00a0 Week four: How do plant a kitchen garden? Gardening as a way of getting children excited about fresh foods; learn what's meant by the terms \"organic\" and \"locally grown\"; learn more creative ideas for serving vegetables, how to involve children in the kitchen and basic techniques for making soups and cooking fish. Week five: Summing it all up. What have we learned about encouraging the right food choices despite environmental challenges like advertising and readily available processed foods? How can we make choices that benefit our health and the health of our planet? Cooking this week: the simple stew, a basic homemade salad dressing plus a Sunday morning treat that will make the whole family smile.Recommended Background\nIf you have access to basic cooking equipment, a source of food ingredients and a healthy dose of curiosity,\nwe welcome you to join\u00a0this course.Suggested Readings\nOptional readings, which can be accessed through the internet via SIPX,\nwill be posted for students who are interested in diving deeper into the course topics.Course Format\nThis course can be enjoyed by a wide variety of students who are interested\nin promoting health and enjoyment throughout their lives and the lives\nof the children they care for.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists", "cat": "1/arts_music_film|5/computer_science|8/engineering_technology", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 122, "desc": "This course provides a complete introduction to programming for digital musicians and\nartists, in the real-time multimedia language ChucK. Rich with practical examples and\npointers to additional web resources, it can be understood by novices wishing to learn to\nprogram interactive arts systems. The course, lecture, and examples build on each other to teach the fundamentals of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects, classes) and also deals with advanced topics including multi-threading, events and signals. \u00a0Throughout the course, students create meaningful and rewarding expressive digital \u201cinstruments\u201d that make sound and music in direct response to program logic.\u00a0 The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks, etc.). \u00a0ChucK is used (unknowingly in most cases, via SMule Apps) by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens of academic programs and laptop orchestras. \u00a0Learning to program using ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr.\u00a0Ge Wang (Stanford University) and Dr. Perry R.\u00a0Cook (Princeton University).Syllabus\nWEEK 1:\u00a0Basics: Sound, Waves, and ChucK ProgrammingWEEK 2: Libraries and ArraysWEEK 3: Sound File ManipulationWEEK 4: FunctionsWEEK 5: Unit Generators and Physical ModelsWEEK 6: Multi-Threading and ConcurrencyWEEK 7: Objects and ClassesWEEK 8: Live Control: Keyboard, Mouse & MIDI\nRecommended Background\nThis course was designed to teach a novice programmer (or an artist new to programming) how to code, but will be useful for more experienced programmers.Suggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, but students are encouraged to purchase the optional textbook for the class,\u00a0Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists: Creating Music with ChucK. A special discount is available for students enrolled in this course -- more information will follow when the course launches in late October.\u00a0Course Format\nThe weekly lectures in this course cover key concepts and skills to help you master the ChucK language, and are complemented by footage of ChucK-programmed projects at work. Students will put those skills into practice through weekly peer-assessed assignments.

What is Climate Change? How should we respond to\nClimate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responses\navailable to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particular\nperspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges and\nopportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe and\nexplain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientist\nsee Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step to\nunderstanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts from\ndifferent disciplines engage with\u00a0the issue. The second step is to appreciate how\nour response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between these\ndifferent approaches.\nThis course offers you an introduction to different\ndisciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Change\naffects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizen\nof your country and as a member of the global community.

This course introduces the basics of the climate system, models and predictions, human and natural impacts, mitigative and adaptive responses, and the evolution of climate policy. This course explores the basic concepts and terms needed to understand the science of climate change, and the available mitigation, adaptation and policy options. By the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\u00b7&nbsp; Tell the story of our climate, describing how interactions among atmosphere, ocean, land, and life lead to climatic changes at all timescales\n\u00b7&nbsp; Evaluate the likely effect of historical human fossil emissions and land use changes on Earth\u2019s energy balance and climate.\n\u00b7&nbsp; Describe the direct observations of climate change in recent decades, and articulate the evidence attributing global warming in this time period to human causes.\n\u00b7&nbsp; Assess the utility - and limits - of climate models to predict global and regional climate change.\n\u00b7&nbsp; Articulate the demographic, economic, technological and political factors that influence both humans\u2019 impact on the climate and humans\u2019 vulnerability to climate change.\n\u00b7&nbsp; Express an informed opinion on the scope and urgency of the efforts needed to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n&nbsp;We provide the scientific basics of climate change paired with the response options (mitigation and adaptation) and policy landscape. Focusing exclusively on the science of climate change may not allow a nuanced understanding of the social implications of this science.&nbsp; Similarly, political or economic analyses of climate change frequently neglect the underlying mechanics behind climate change thresholds, feedbacks, and the potential for abrupt change. This course explores linkages between climate change and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such as biodiversity and water quality).&nbsp; We acknowledge the urgent need to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits) simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives.&nbsp;Syllabus\nClimate Literacy is delivered in ten Modules.&nbsp; The first half of the course deals mainly with climate change science and models, while the second half of the course speaks to climate change impacts, response options, and polices.&nbsp; The Modules are as follows:&nbsp;\n1.\n&nbsp;Climate in the public sphere\nClimate change is a pervasive and challenging phenomenon that can be viewed through a multitude of lenses. A scientific lens, for instance, reveals altered ecosystems and climatic tipping points while the lens of ethics raises the question of the right to develop and influence the well-being of others while doing so. This module will introduce you to a few of the core concepts that you will need to delve deeper into the science and policy of climate change. We will explore the broad findings offered by the scientific community with regard to our influence on the climate system, the policy tools that we have developed to respond to this challenge, and the core of the climate change debate in scientific, political, and lay communities.\n2.\n&nbsp;Introduction to the climate system\nIn this first module of the science section of\nthe course, we\u2019ll look at the big picture of Earth\u2019s climate system.&nbsp; What are the parts?&nbsp; What are some of the major interactions among\nthe parts?&nbsp; We\u2019ll spend some time\nlearning about the energy-related units we\u2019ll use in this course, some basics\nof systems dynamics, which is one of the overarching frameworks in this course,\nand then we\u2019ll have a look at data showing how Earth\u2019s climate has changed over\ntime.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;\nEarth's\nenergy budget\nThis module covers the basics of climatology at the planetary scale. We will trace the path of energy coming in from the Sun and leaving the planet as thermal radiation (or infrared), and explore the various factors affecting these flows: greenhouse gases, aerosols, surface albedo, and clouds. We will investigate how humans influence these climate controls, and compare anthropogenic factors to natural factors such as variation in solar energy and volcanic eruptions.\n4.\nThe carbon cycle\nOur planet breathes; its biosphere on land and in the oceans inhales and exhales oxygen and carbon dioxide every second. Even water and rocks exchange carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. Humans, particularly through deforestation and fossil fuel use, have a significant impact on the planetary carbon cycle. This module explores the natural carbon cycle, the perturbations in carbon stocks and flows from human activities, and the climate system's response to human perturbations. 5.\n&nbsp;Climate models\nClimate models are crucial tools to help people understand the complexities and dynamic interactions within Earth's climate system.&nbsp; Models are built on our understanding of basic physics and Earth processes, and are grounded in observations and measurements of the world around us.&nbsp; In this module, we'll explore different types of climate models, consider some of the choices you'd need to make as a climate modeler, and have a look at some climate model output compared to observations.&nbsp; Since we only have one planet, and can only run one global climate experiment in the real world, models are our only tools to help us peer into the future and ask \"what if...\" questions.&nbsp; The range of probable outcomes from possible future scenarios helps us make decisions about mitigation and adaptation.&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;\nFuture climate\nNow that we have a clearer sense of the principles, components and assumptions of climate models, we\u2019ll look more closely at their results. Given hypothetical future pathways, including possibilities for our own future actions, like carbon emissions, what range of temperature increases can we expect? How will future changes affect the climatic factors that are most relevant to humans and ecosystems: precipitation, circulation patterns, extreme events, melting of snow and ice, etc? These global projections give us estimates of what we can expect if we embark on various emission and development paths, and offer a broad view for decision-making. The least well-known aspect of these projections is what choices we, the human community, will make in the future. 7.\n&nbsp;Climate change impacts\nAs we have seen, the emission of vast quantities of greenhouse gases by humans fundamentally influences the global climatic system. The chain reaction does not end here, however. Rising temperatures and sea levels, changing precipitation patterns, and ocean acidification, for instance, trigger dramatic shifts in the way that human and natural systems function.\nThis module forms the transition between the science of climate change, which we have explored in Modules 2-6, and the more human-oriented Modules 7-10.\n8.\n&nbsp;Climate change mitigation: dealing with the\ncauses\nNow that we understand the central causes of anthropogenic climate change, and the impacts that we can expect to (and already) experience, the next step is to explore the response options that are available to us. The most commonly-discussed response to climate change is mitigation: tackling the causes of climate change by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The aim of mitigation is to reduce the severity and frequency of climate change impacts, thereby protecting ecosystems and human societies.\nThis module will explore the basic concept of mitigation, the core mitigation strategies that we currently have available to us, the innovative action that is being taken around the world, and leading-edge ideas with regard to tackling the roots of climate change. By the end of this module, you will be able to critique the likelihood of implementation of many of these strategies, and will have a framework through which you can learn more about greenhouse gas management, both at home and around the world.\n9.\n&nbsp;Climate change adaptation: dealing with the\neffects\nIn contrast to the previous module, this module introduces the idea of addressing the impacts of climate change rather than its causes. In particular, we will explore the various adaptation strategies that are available to be utilized around the world, the heated debate surrounding the equity implications of adaptation, and the linkages between adaptation and mitigation. By the end of this module we will have explored the difference between proactive and reactive adaptation, and our track record with both. We will outline the most common and effective adaptation strategies, including those related to human settlements, ecosystems, and the broader issue of development. Finally, we will explore the inevitable trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, setting us up to finish this course with a survey of climate change response policies.\n10.\n&nbsp;Policy\ntools for mitigation and adaptation\nThis Module forms a bridge between this first course in the Decision-making for Climate Change series, and the three courses that will follow. Given what we know now about the science behind climate change, and the strategies that we have at our disposal for responding to it, we can now be introduced to policies that bear this in mind. After being introduced to the fundamentals of mitigation and adaptation policy, we will use the British Columbia carbon tax and the proposed cap-and-trade system in the United States as relevant examples. Finally, we will finish with a glimpse forward to the future of climate change policy, and the most promising opportunities for both managing impacts and ensuring a rapid transition to a fundamentally low-carbon development path.Recommended Background\nThis course is open to anyone.&nbsp; No particular background is needed.&nbsp; We hope you'll join us!Course Format\nThis course includes video lessons, open-access readings and other activities.&nbsp; There are weekly quizzes (10-12 questions), 2 assignments, which ask participants to document aspects of climate science and policy in their area, discussion forums, and a final exam.&nbsp; All aspects of the course can be completed asynchronously - there are no set times that anybody needs to be online.&nbsp; You are welcome to do as much or as little of the course as meets your own goals.&nbsp; "}
{"lang": "en", "name": "Clinical Terminology for International and U.S. Students", "cat": "12/medicine_health", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 129, "desc": "Understanding the clinical terms and abbreviations commonly used in U.S. hospitals is challenging. Adaptation to clinical language is difficult for U.S. students entering the clinical area and even more difficult for international students whose primary language is not English. This course helps both groups of students understand many of the terms and abbreviations commonly encountered during the first three months of clinical work on a U.S. general hospital unit. The language of health care providers at U.S. clinical sites is heavily infused with abbreviations and technical terms. Frequently, there is little time to ask for explanations. This course focuses on terms and abbreviations that will be heard or seen during early clinical work. Terms are presented according to the clinical context in which they will be experienced using print, audio and visual representations. A web-based clinical dictionary for beginners provides additional information about terms presented in the course as well as definitions of many important terms that could not be covered in the six week course.Syllabus Week 1: Understanding the structure of clinical terms and abbreviations Clinical Focus: Vital Signs Week 2: Solving clinical word puzzles Clinical Focus: The Clinical Unit and Bedside Environment Week 3: Refining strategies for solving clinical word puzzles Clinical Focus: Emergencies, Medication and IV fluid Administration Week 4: Dealing with acronyms Clinical Focus: Diseases and Related Abbreviations Week 5: Using clinical language safely Clinical Focus: Laboratory Tests and Diagnostic Procedures Week 6: Assessing your ability to use what you have learned Clinical Conversations: Practice hearing, seeing, and responding to true-to-life clinical situations\nRecommended Background\nThis course is for International and U.S. students and health professionals who are beginning or will be experiencing clinical practice in the United States. Knowledge of anatomy and physiology and common disease states supports success.Suggested Readings\nAll references and materials will be offered within the course or found on the Internet.Course Format\nThis course consists of 6 modules introduced by a video presentation. Using a language-learning approach, definitions of terms and abbreviations are supplemented with audio, images, and video-recordings. Strategies for effective learning and opportunities to use new terms and abbreviations are offered. Quiz questions accompany each module. A web-based clinical terminology dictionary at http://www.ClinicalTerminology.org provides additional information about the course content and definitions of many additional terms and abbreviations not included in the course. The web-based dictionary remains available to students after the course is completed.FAQ\nQuestion: Why do I need to learn these terms, abbreviations and\nacronyms? Response: Medical terms, abbreviations and acronyms are a large part of the verbal and written communication that occurs in clinical situations in the U.S. Abbreviations are used to increase efficiency by shortening the time to communicate. If you want to join in any conversation about clinical matters, you need to understand terms, abbreviations and acronyms.\nQuestion: Why can\u2019t I just ask for clarification when someone\nuses a term or abbreviation? Response: Of course you can always ask for clarification. However, clinical settings in U.S. hospitals are often very busy, noisy places with people hurrying about to meet patients\u2019 needs. There will be little time for explanation of the meanings of words. The more emergent the situation, the more likely that abbreviations will be used. When you know a term or abbreviation before you hear it on the clinical unit, you are a better communicator and a more effective healthcare team member.\nQuestion: Will I learn all the medical or nursing abbreviations\nand acronyms? Response: No. This is a course for beginning students. A major advantage is that the course helps you to focuses on those terms that you are most likely to hear or see during your early clinical training.\nQuestion: How will this course\nhelp me in my healthcare studies and clinical practice? Response: This course emphasizes learning to recognize and interpret common spoken and written clinical terms and abbreviations necessary for clear communication with patients and health care providers. Understanding and learning clinical language will help you to function more effectively and safely as a healthcare team member.\nQuestion: Will I be able to interact with other students taking\nthis course? Response: Yes. The Clinical Terminology General Discussion Board is available for communication and meet-ups are encouraged.\nWhat\nif I have a question about the course? Response: Since the course engages thousands of students, the instructors cannot communicate directly with each student. You are encouraged to post questions, comments, problems, and ideas on the Clinical Terminology General Discussion Board.

Clinical problem solving or diagnostic reasoning is the skill that physicians use to understand a patient\u2019s complaints and then to identify a short, prioritized list of possible diagnoses that could account for those complaints. &nbsp;This differential diagnosis then drives the choice of diagnostic tests and possible treatments. Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set. &nbsp;While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.\n&nbsp;\nThis course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving. The professor will use cases to illustrate different reasoning strategies and will discuss how both correct and incorrect diagnoses result from these strategies. Participants will use sample clinical cases to practice what they have learned through the lectures. Finally, the professor will discuss strategies to help students and young physicians read textbooks and articles in a way that enhances their ability to use information in the clinical environment.&nbsp;\nSyllabus\nModule 1: How experts understand diseases and how to read like an expert to form disease based illness scripts.Module 2: How experts analyze their patient' problems: processing and the patient illness script.Module 3: Using disease and patient illness scripts to prioritize differential diagnostic possibilities into tiers of probabilityModule 4: Understanding how diagnostic tests can be appropriately used to improve diagnostic accuracy.Module 5: Diagnostic Mistakes: how they happen, how you can avoid them and how to find them once they occur.Module 6: How our clinical problem solving strategies can be used to write good test questions, perform well on tests, and teach others to do well too.Recommended Background\nMedical Terminology\nIntroduction to Physical Diagnosis\nSuggested Readings\nRecommended textbook (not required):&nbsp;Current Medical Diagnosis &amp; Treatment,&nbsp;eds Papadakis,\nMcPhee, and Rabow (2012 or 2013 edition)Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 8 and 12 minutes in length.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Coaching Teachers: Promoting Changes that Stick", "cat": "9/humanities|14/social_sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 133, "desc": "Learn and practice strategies for coaching teachers to make meaningful, long-lasting improvements in their instruction. Teachers face a blizzard of decisions. Scholars estimate\nthat teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day, most of\nwhich are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are the\nmyriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning, assessing student\nwork, and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy, it\u2019s\neasy for \u201cbad\u201d habits to set in, and hard to break them once they do.\nThe question then becomes: How in such a fast-paced environment can coaches\nand instructional leaders help teachers execute changes in their practice that\nactually stick?&nbsp; Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable about\ninstruction; they\u2019re also highly strategic in their approach to changing\nteachers\u2019 behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive critical\nfeedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds to\nensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity. Oftentimes, teacher coaching suffers from a lack of\ndirection, a lack of support, or both. The coach might tell the teacher to \u201cDo\nX,\u201d but then fail to articulate clear, measurable steps for\nimplementation.&nbsp; Most commonly, coaches\ncan be overly suggestive, telling the teacher \u201cYou might do X, Y, and Z,\nand maybe even A, B, and C, too.\u201d With an already very full plate, this\napproach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first, undercutting\nthe likelihood of meaningful change. Even teacher coaching that\u2019s described as \u201cgood\u201d can sometimes\nfall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say the\nright things, and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. But\nunless the coaching drives true changes in behavior, the \u201cgood\u201d in this case\ncould actually end up being the enemy of effective. Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches who\nprovide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Course\nparticipants will be introduced to Match\u2019s key ideas and techniques for coaching teachers with an eye towards creating sustained changes in their practice.\nSyllabus\nWeek 1This week\u2019s content will introduce you to our big ideas about effective teacher coaching. In particular, we will draw a distinction between what is sometimes thought of as \u201cgood\u201d coaching, and what we consider to be \u201ceffective\u201d coaching that promotes meaningful change in the classroom and more student learning.You will also be introduced to our Effective Coaching Formula, the variables of which will be the topics for the subsequent three weeks.&nbsp;Week 2The Fixed Mindset Tax is the learning penalty a coach pays when working with a teacher who does not believe that they are capable of growing their practice or mastering a particular teacher skill. This week offers practical solutions for overcoming what Carol Dweck refers to as \u201cfixed mindset\u201d in a teacher coaching session, as well as tools for promoting a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d that will allow teachers to be motivated and optimistic about improving their practice.Week 3The Clarity of Instructional Vision is the extent to which coach and teacher agree and can communicate about what constitutes excellent instruction. This week will make the case for the importance of developing a common instructional language, and will also introduce you in great detail to the Match Teacher Residency vision for an optimal learning environment.Week 4Quality of Feedback is all about organizing an effective teacher coaching meeting. You will learn the Match Teacher Residency protocol for structuring your debrief cycle by watching examples of the protocol in action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 5Time to show what you know! This week is for completing the final assessment, the Coaching Debrief Annotation Assignment. The assignment will ask you to view a teacher coaching meeting and annotate the conversation by indicating the various best practices you have learned during the previous four weeks.Course Learning Outcomeso&nbsp;&nbsp; To describe and analyze strategies that help a teacher develop a growth mindset about accepting and acting on critical feedback.o&nbsp;&nbsp; To describe and analyze tools (e.g. observation rubrics) that help teachers and coaches develop a shared vocabulary and vision about excellent classroom practice.o&nbsp;&nbsp; To derive clear and measurable improvement goals for teachers based on observations of their practice.o&nbsp;&nbsp; To describe and analyze protocols for delivering directive, actionable feedback to teachers.Recommended Background\nThis course is appropriate for any educator who has an interest in coaching teachers. Course participants do not need to be currently coaching, mentoring or supervising teachers. \u00a0Participants should, however, have some experience as full-time classroom teachers in a K-12 setting prior to taking the course.\u00a0Course Format\nThis\ncourse will have five highly interactive 90 minute sessions that are a mix of\nshort lectures, videos of classroom practice, reading, and analytical written\nexercises. Students\nwill be assessed via two mechanisms: (1) Multiple choice quizzes that address\ndescriptions of key concepts; and (2) short-answer analysis and description of\nteaching techniques. Peer\nassessment is required for the short-answer writing exercises.\u00a0The\ncourse instructional team will schedule times after each session for\ninteracting with students via the course\u2019s Discussion Board.\n\u201cCoaching Teachers\u201d will\nlaunch in January 2014.

Its governing question is simple: by what terms can we discuss comic books as literary art? In pursuit of that question it develops a theory of literary reading and time itself.\nVisit us at www.facebook.com/UCBComics or bit.ly/project10-4 to see some student-created comics from 2013! The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species\nof pulp fiction on the margins of children\u2019s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing\nnumber of university classrooms and bookstore shelves.\n\u201cComic Books and Graphic Novels\u201d presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and\nparticipate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself.

In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public\u2019s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of \u2018community\u2019 and the processes by which we \u2018diagnose\u2019 or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.

You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines! This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.\nThe course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.\nAn optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!\nWhy Study Compilers?\nEverything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.\nFAQ\nWill I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nHow is the class structured?\nEach week there will be a number of videos to watch, most of which will include an in-video quiz question to answer. Most weeks there will also be homeworks (done on-line) and a quiz. There will be also be a midterm and a final exam. For those doing the course project, there will be 5 programming assignments, which you will do on your own using infrastructure that we provide.\nAre the lectures available in a file format?\nYes. The slides from the lectures will be available in both annotated and unannotated form.\nDo I need a textbook?\nNo, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular:\nCompilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition)Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman.Addison-Wesley\nModern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition)Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg.Cambridge University Press\nEngineering a CompilerKeith Cooper and Linda TorczonMorgan Kaufman\nHow do I ask questions?\nThere will be an on-line discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. While the scale of an on-line class means that often the fastest (and best!) answer comes from another student, the course staff will monitor the discussions for accuracy and to address questions where the student community particularly wants to hear from the staff.\nIs the compiler project required?\nNo. You can take the class without doing the programming assignments.\nHow difficult is the compiler project? What background and tools do I need?\nThis question is very hard to answer as the level of difficulty will vary depending on your programming background. As a rough guide, you should already be an experienced programmer and be comfortable writing substantial C++ or Java programs; writing a compiler is not a good way to learn either programming or these particular languages. The project also makes use of software tools, so you should also be comfortable learning to use new tools on your own. It is not a problem if you start the project but don't finish it; we will just consider you to be enrolled in the non-project option of the class in this case.\n"}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Analysis of a Complex Kind", "cat": "15/mathematics_statistics_and_data_analysis", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 143, "desc": "In this course we\u2019ll explore complex analysis, complex dynamics, and some applications of these topics. Complex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane, i.e. functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. In order to study the behavior of such functions we\u2019ll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We\u2019ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we\u2019ve answered these questions we\u2019ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of these that\u2019s quite alright, but do look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for example to see some beautiful pictures).When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation \u2013 a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.&nbsp; After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We\u2019ll explore these properties! Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we\u2019ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we\u2019ll integrate over? Curves! We\u2019ll study these as well, and we\u2019ll tie everything together via Cauchy\u2019s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.&nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout this course we'll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won't be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures. Syllabus\nWeek One: Introduction to complex numbers, their geometry and algebra, working with complex numbers.Week Two: The Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, a famous outstanding conjecture, history of complex numbers, sequences of complex numbers and convergence, complex functions.Week Three: Complex differentiation and the Cauchy-Riemann equations.Week Four: Conformal mappings, M\u00f6bius transformations and the Riemann mapping theorem.Week Five: Complex integration, Cauchy-Goursat theorem, Cauchy integral formula, Liouville's Theorem, maximum principle, fundamental theorem of algebra.Week Six: Power series representation of analytic functions, singularities, the Riemann zeta function, Riemann hypothesis, relation to prime numbers.Recommended Background\nA willingness to remember calculus is very useful, though enthusiasm and interest in learning are more important than any prior knowledge.Suggested Readings\nYou are not required to purchase a textbook for this course.

{"lang": "en", "name": "English Composition I: Achieving Expertise", "cat": "9/humanities|14/social_sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 146, "desc": "You will gain a foundation for college-level writing valuable for nearly any field. Students will learn how to read carefully, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, engage with others' ideas, cite accurately, and craft powerful prose. We will create a workshop environment. English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prose that meets readers\u2019 expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.&nbsp;\nTwo overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:&nbsp; 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others, you can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. **English Composition I has earned a Certificate of Recognition from Quality Matters, a non-profit dedicated to quality in online education.**\nSyllabus\nUnit 1 (Weeks 1-3): Critical ReviewHow do we become experts? I will ask you to draft and revise a critical response to an article about expertise by one of several different authors . You will draw on your selected area of expertise to respond to the author's arguments. Specifically, we will focus on how to:read critically;summarize, question, analyze, and evaluate written text;engage with the work of others;understand the stages of the writing process;workshop writing;respond towards revision;incorporate reader feedback;integrate quotes/evidence;cite the work of others; andcraft effective titles.Unit 2 (Weeks 4-5): Explicating a Visual ImageWhat does expertise look like? How do we define it? I will ask you to select a visual image depicting your selected area of expertise and then explicate that image in order to make an argument about what expertise looks like and how it can be defined. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Unit 1, as well as build on them by focusing on how to:summarize, questions, analyze, and evaluate visual texts;argue and support a position;use evidence;achieve cohesion;develop paragraph unity;revise; andeditUnit 3 (Weeks 6-9): Case StudyWhat can we learn about expertise in a particular area? What does it take to succeed? I will ask you to research a particular example of expert achievement in your selected area and, drawing on multiple resources, make an argument about expertise. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Units 1 and 2, as well as build on them by focusing on how to: conduct research;write an extended argument;examine disciplinary expectations;develop an intertextual conversation;understand popular sources and scholarly sources;create effective introductions; andwrite strong conclusions.Unit 4 (Weeks 10-12): Writing an Op-EdWhat do you think people need to know about expertise in your selected area? In this fourth and final unit, we will turn to a more public form of writing as I ask you to write an op-ed (opposite the editorial page) about your selected area of expertise for a publication of your choosing (you do not actually have to submit it to that publication). We'll also be working together to collaboratively crowdsource a bibliography of potential resources. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Units 1,2, and 3, as well as build on them by focusing on how to:write for publics;write concisely;edit and proofread thoroughly;decide whether to use active or passive verbs; andtransfer writing skills to new writing contexts.Recommended Background\nStudents should have basic English proficiency and exposure\nto secondary-level (high-school level) English or composition&nbsp;Suggested Readings\nStudents are encouraged to refer to the materials in this open-source textbook for additional help with their writing: Writing Commons Course Format\nBy engaging with ~40 interactive instructional\nvideos (each ~six-eight minutes in length), students will research, draft, and\nrevise the following four major projects in sequenced stages and with feedback\nfrom their peers: a critical review of an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an\nexplication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words); and an\nOp-Ed about expertise (500-750 words). Smaller assignments enable students to build up\nto these projects; these include directed reflections, forum participation,\nresponse papers, peer review, practice quizzes, polls, discussions, and\nsurveys. FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will\nreceive a&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;signed by the instructor. Will I get feedback on my written work? Yes. There are peer evaluations of your work that are the basis of the course grade. In addition, Professor Comer and her teaching staff will model effective feedback practices so class members can respond productively to one another. We will also hold several in-time virtual workshops, and use selected student writing for examples (anonymously and with your permission).Will this course provide instruction on grammar? No. Although grammar is important and resources on grammar will be provided, this course is focused primarily on how to write effective arguments. This involves asking meaningful questions, engaging with the work of others, and writing powerful prose. We will focus at times on sentence-level aspects of writing, including how to write more concisely, but our primary interest is in communicating your ideas effectively to readers through the use of argument and evidence.Will the course be especially difficult if a student is not very proficient in the English language? We welcome cultural and linguistic diversity, and will tailor the course to meet the needs of learners with varying levels of familiarity and facility with the English language. Part of our work will involve discussions about how different people use language, and what different expectations people bring to writing. These conversations will be strengthened with the inclusion of people who speak a wide variety of languages. We will have an expert on English as a Second Language working with our course to provide resources, model feedback practices, facilitate productive conversations, and provide instruction at times.Will this course be geared primarily to writing in English Literature courses?&nbsp;No. This course will help you with academic writing in all disciplines. We will have experts working with the course who have doctorates across the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities, and we will address disciplinary conventions explicitly. We will ask you to reflect on how you can transfer the writing knowledge you gain in this course to other writing experiences you might have in various disciplines.What is the song in the promo video and why is it there? Throughout the course, we will be including songs about writing. We will include links to the songs and (if available) the artist web pages on our course wiki page. The song in the intro video is \"Writing Backwards\" by the group impossible songs."}

This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is \"control theory\", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, &nbsp;(2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.While the main focus of this course is theory, it is important to be able to map the theory onto an actual physical platform. As such, the course&nbsp;will provide detailed instructions on how to build a mobile robot from scratch as an optional part of the course. In addition, an introduction into microcontrollers, mechatronics, and electronics will be given so that, by the end of the course, the controllers developed in the course can run on an actual mobile robot.The course will also feature optional programming assignments, which will&nbsp;focus on implementing the controllers developed in this course for a&nbsp;mobile robot. A MATLAB-based simulator will be available run controllers&nbsp;from the programming assignments on a simulated robot or on the mobile&nbsp;robot built in this course. As a result of support from MathWorks, a&nbsp;downloadable license for MATLAB and course recommended toolboxes will be&nbsp;available for the duration of the MOOC.Recommended Background\nWorking knowledge of basic calculus, linear algebra and differential equations is recommended.&nbsp;Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 8 and 12 minutes in length.

It\nstarts a \u201cconversation\u201d with users and stakeholders inside and outside\nan organization.&nbsp; Conversations are the natural way people think about\ncomplex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop \u201cstories,\u201d\nwhich lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy\npractitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises \u2013 in all departments\nand sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.\nIn this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that\nif they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their\njob descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier\n\u2013 creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is\nvalued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their\nenterprise stand out.\nRegardless of their area of work, position or expertise, Content Strategy\npractitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile\nmedia to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,\nactionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic\ncontent they produce enhances the user\u2019s lives and&nbsp;deepens their\nunderstanding and engagement with the organization.\nContent Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it\nis done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,\ntrustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.\nOften it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional\njournalism under-serves or does not reach.&nbsp;Syllabus\nIn this course, professionals at all levels of an organization will learn the best ways to engage an audience they want and need by smartly implementing their important, strategic stories and information and by using proven tools and techniques to enhance an audience\u2019s experiences and interest.To earn a Verified Certificate, learners must watch the MOOC's videos, answer the Learning Questions that accompany each video, participate in the discussion forums, develop and complete a Case Study, and evaluate the cases of three other MOOC participants.Recommended Background\nThis MOOC serves professionals who want to learn to create trustable,\nengaging and often interactive content to advance their enterprise\u2019s future.\nThis MOOC is for people anywhere in an organization who have content development\nexperience and now want to significantly improve their abilities to understand\naudiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics and videos to\nconvey their organization\u2019s most important goals.FAQ\nWill I get a certificate for completing this course?\nYes.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Student Thinking at the Core", "cat": "9/humanities|14/social_sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 156, "desc": "This course explores how teachers can capitalize on what students bring to the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings - to advance the learning of all students in the class, a practice we call \u201cleveraging student thinking\u201d. As good teachers know, our most important resource(s) in classroom interaction\nare the ideas and experiences our students bring with them. The past two\ndecades of research on learning, and more recent framings of academic goals\n(especially the Common Core State Standards) bring this insight to the\nforefront. This short course, designed for as few as four weeks and as many\nas eight, asks how teachers can and do capitalize on what students bring\nto the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings \u2013 to\nadvance the learning of all students in the class.\nOur overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students to learn challenging subject matter \u2013 a practice we call \u201cleveraging student thinking\u201d.\nCourse content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable to all subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational tools to: elicit student thinking, attend to significant features of that thinking, interpret students\u2019 ideas within a developmental framework, and bridge from students\u2019 current understandings to more sophisticated understandings.\nThese ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases. Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental and managerial \u201cpressure points\u201d that challenge teachers\u2019 ability to capitalize on student thinking in constructive ways.Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms,&nbsp;be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)&nbsp; The goal is to&nbsp;work on the work of teaching&nbsp;while&nbsp;teaching.In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course. &nbsp;At&nbsp;key&nbsp;points, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback.&nbsp;Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers to&nbsp;plan to work through&nbsp;this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion. Teachers&nbsp;who&nbsp;do not have a team at the beginning of the course&nbsp;will be able to create a team through&nbsp;online forums at the beginning of the course&nbsp;and can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.Syllabus\nThis course justifies and unpacks a teaching practice we call leveraging student thinking. &nbsp;This practice (actually a constellation of practices) supports important educational goals including, but not limited to, achievement as outlined in the Common Core State Standards. The elements of leveraging are:&nbsp;eliciting student thinking&nbsp;attending to significant features of that thinking&nbsp;interpreting students' ideas within a developmental frameworkbridging from students' current understandings to more sophisticated understandingsOver the course of four lessons we will explore each element listed above. We will be drawing upon both our own* and others' research,as well as the insights of practicing teachers.&nbsp;* We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for their support of the research on which this course is based and the preparation of the materials found here: &nbsp;\"Linking Teacher Preparation to Student Learning in Mathematics and Science\", National Science Foundation, Award ID 0554486.&nbsp;Lesson 1: Eliciting Student Thinking at the Core&nbsp;(available on August 19)Goal:&nbsp;Design a better task -- i.e., one that will more effectively get students\u2019 thinking on the table.&nbsp;Essential Questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does it mean to leverage student thinking?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is leveraging student thinking educative?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can you design tasks to more effectively elicit student thinking and make students' understandings more visible? &nbsp;Assignments:&nbsp;Design a task to effectively elicit student thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete survey.Lesson 2: Anticipating and Interpreting Student Thinking&nbsp;(available on August 26)Goal:&nbsp;Locate your students' thinking (elicited in assignment #2) within a developmental framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;Essential Questions:&nbsp;What\u2019s the developmental trajectory that links students' current understandings of particular concepts to more sophisticated understandings?&nbsp;What does it mean to locate student thinking within a trajectory of development?Assignments:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort the student work you collected from least to most sophisticated.

Also, as instructions and forums are English-langugage centric, is it necessary that all participants be able to work through the English medium. At times this can be troublesome for those participants who teach a class in a language other than English but should not be prohibitive of contribution. We also recommend joining the course with colleagues, friends, or family who can form a \u201ccritical partnership\u201d in thinking through \u2013 and putting into practice \u2013 the ideas of the course.Course Format\nThe course will be built around teacher participants' guided engagement\nwith their own teaching practice (documented by video-recording, audio-recording, or post hoc note taking) in the company of teacher colleagues or on-line partners who serve as \"critical friends\".&nbsp;&nbsp;Short instructor video presentations as well as panel discussions are interspersed with video clips of teaching\npractice to illustrate concepts and practices. Assignments will require\nreview of one's own and one other's developing practice. &nbsp;Reflective writing on the experience of engaging in the assigned practices will be peer-assessed.&nbsp;FAQ What resources will I need for this class? You will get the most out of this course if you have access to videotaping equipment (as simple as your own FlipVideo Camera) and if you engage in this course with one or more teaching colleagues. However, you can still benefit if you join us solo and if you are not able to videotape your teaching. We do, however, strongly suggest partnering up with another CoreThink participant once the course gets going. How can I find a partner or partners if I join the course alone? We will create a bulletin board that will enable participants to \"partner up\" with others in similar teaching situations. This stage of the course will require a bit more work on the participants' end as you search for your partner or group.&nbsp; Can I get professional development credit for this course?\nThis is a great question but not one we can answer. Please check with your principal or other district/school official to determine whether the kind of experience this course offers can meet professional development guidelines.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Critical Perspectives on Management", "cat": "3/business_management", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 161, "desc": "An unconventional approach to management strategy! This class offers students the opportunity to explore today's management practices from unexpected perspectives in order to ask provocative questions about the modern business environment. This approach will allow us to interrogate key management concepts in order to explore the thinking that informs them and, as importantly, the form of capitalism they foster. This course is designed for students of all backgrounds who have an interest in how firms are governed, the forces that have helped define modern management practice, and the outcomes of that practice not only for the firm itself, but also for the societies in which they operate. For students who are thinking of a career in management, it may also prove useful as a basic introduction to some of the conceptual vocabulary and ideas behind modern theories of management.&nbsp;Using a wide disciplinary approach - from economics and history to social theory and even a smattering of biblical criticism - the course will invite students to consider several core management strategies and priorities from often unexpected perspectives in order to judge their success or failure. The key objective of the course is to bring into critical focus how\nwe think about the function and culture of management, how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take\ndecisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure.&nbsp;Topics include: the\nfunction of the firm; the role of incentive; the ways in which narrative forces shape decision making, and how market relationships define the\nmanagerial culture in ways that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.Update: the Facebook group is now open for enrolled students in this class. Click here to join: https://www.facebook.com/groups/630276887018610/&nbsp;Syllabus\nThis syllabus is final.\u00a0Week 1 - The Lessons from Rome (I)In Ancient Rome, merchant organisations very similar to modern firms were critical to capitalising key markets and to solving serious logistical problems to enable a vibrant trading network across the Mediterranean, including, critically, supplying the city of Rome itself with the food its citizens needed to survive. We will examine the Roman grain market and the organisations that operated within that market to ask: what, exactly, is a firm? What led to the firm's evolution? And what is the issue of agency that a firm inevitably entails? \u00a0Week 2 - The Lessons from Rome (II)This lecture expands upon the first discussion, drawing from the insights gained about firm organisation in the Ancient world to ask about the effectiveness of the Forced Distribution Ranking Scheme (also known as \"stack and rank\", \"up and out\", etc...) to evaluate and promote or terminate employees, widely used by many of today's leading corporations.\u00a0Week 3 - What is Innovation?We live in the innovation economy. Firms have chief innovation officers. Innovation is, so we are told, the key to securing the future. And there are quite literally millions of books on the subject of innovation. So, what does it mean? And is it a useful idea for management? We'll consider both questions.\u00a0Week 4 - The Power of NarrativeWhat do Hollywood movies, the Synoptic gospels, housing bubbles, Alan Greenspan's monetary policy, and the world's worst merger have in common?\u00a0This week's lecture will develop a reading of narrative in order to explore a common pitfall that affects many managerial decisions.\nWeek 5 - Is Shareholder Value a Good Idea?\u00a0Perhaps the most important lecture of the course. Almost all publicly traded firms are beholden, either explicitly or implicitly, to the principle of creating shareholder value. This week, we look at the history of this idea, how it has become widespread as a principle of corporate governance and how it has changed fundamentally the nature of the firm over the last 40 years. We will look at who the shareholders are, where their interests lie and what they have gained from this development. We will consider the wider and long-term consequences both for the firm and society. And we will ask - is this the kind of capitalism we really want?\u00a0 \u00a0Week 6 - Case Studies\u00a0We look at the examples of two companies whose recent experiences encapsulate many of the core ideas of the course.\u00a0Recommended Background\nNo background\nis required; all are welcome!Suggested Readings\nComplementary copies of the required course readings will be made available.

Critical thinking is the ability to gather and assess information and evidence in a balanced and reflective way to reach conclusions that are justified by reasoned argument based on the available evidence. Critical thinking is a key skill in the information age, valuable in all disciplines and professions. This introductory course will give you the opportunity to better understand what critical thinking is, and to practice and enhance your critical thinking skills. To do so, we will use the context of some important global challenges that affect us all, and to which we have no clear \u201ccorrect\u201d solutions: for example, the risk and spread of serious infectious diseases in epidemics in modern societies, the implications of increasing human population on global resources, energy, environment and climate, and the challenges of human health and wellbeing in the modern world. Possible solutions to global issues such as these are hotly debated, and give the perfect setting to practice recognizing and evaluating facts, ideas, opinions and arguments. The relevant background information for each global challenge will be provided to ensure that you can complete the exercises. Note, however, this course is not a course on these global challenges themselves; instead it uses the context of these thought-provoking challenges to practice critical thinking.Subtitles for all video lectures available:&nbsp;Portuguese (provided by the&nbsp;Lemann Foundation), EnglishSyllabus\nWeek 1: What is Critical thinking, and why is it important?\nWeek 2: \u2018Credibility and Relevance\u2019: Understanding where information comes from and the nature of evidence\nWeek 3: \u2018Assessing arguments\u2019 1/2&nbsp;\nWeek 4: \u2018Assessing arguments\u2019 2/2&nbsp;\nWeek 5: Developing arguments\nThe course will provide \u2018Global Challenge\u2019 themes for students to work on for the purpose of \u2018Assessing arguments\u2019 in weeks 3 &amp; 4. We recommend that students normally select only one of the themes to focus on.Recommended Background\nThere is no prerequisite to take this course. No prior knowledge in the four \u2018Global challenge\u2019 themes is required.Course Format\nThe course contains lectures, quizzes and exercises. There is an additional final exam for those wanting to get a certificate of accomplishment.This is a basic, informal and very pragmatic course, which focuses on getting you to think rationally and critically about evidence, and does not attempt to teach you about logic, reasoning and knowledge in a formal way. Short lectures will briefly present key concepts and definitions, but it is by actually doing and completing 'real -world' exercises and quizzes, and discussing them with your fellow students, that you will learn how to think critically about the information that surround us.\nFAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors.\nDo I earn University of Edinburgh credits upon completion of the course?\nNo. The&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment is not part of a formal qualification from the University. However, it may be useful to demonstrate prior learning and interest in your subject to a higher education institution or potential employer.\nWhat resources will I need for this class? We will provide a list of \u2018starter\u2019 resources for each week. As the understanding of what makes a reliable resource is a key aspect of the course, you will also be asked to do your own research on the internet to find additional resources to complete the exercises.\nWhat are the learning outcomes of this course and why should I take it?\nBy the end of the course you will have a better understanding of where information comes from, how to validate or refute arguments and how to develop your own arguments based on the available information."}

Computers can appear very complicated, but in reality, computers work within just a few, simple patterns. CS101 demystifies and brings those patterns to life, which is useful for anyone using computers today.\nIn CS101, students play and experiment with short bits of \"computer code\" to bring to life to the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within the browser, so there is no extra software to download or install.

There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week.\nWhat sort of written support is there for the lectures?\nEach lecture comes with written document that parallels the video explanation, so there is something you can review after the lecture that includes all the examples and whatnot. Or put another way, you do not need to take detailed notes of the lecture -- it's already been done for you.\nIs any actual work required for this course?\nYes. CS101 has a \"lab\" component where students play with short bits of computer code, on their way to understanding the nature of computers.\nIs a computer background needed for this course?\nNot at all. The course assumes zero computer knowledge. Everything you need to do in the labs will first be explained and demonstrated in the lectures.\nDo I need any particular software?\nEverything should work in a recent browser, so that should be simple. We'll have a list of which browser versions we've tested before the course starts.\nWhat computer language is used for CS101?\nCS101 uses a variant of Javascript. However, the code used in CS101 is very stripped down, avoiding all sorts of boilerplate that would get in the way of learning. As a result, CS101 code does not look like full, professional Javascript code.\nIs CS101 a full programming course?\nNo. CS101 uses code to explore the nature of computers, but does not pursue code in the depth of a full programming course. Certainly CS101 students will have a real understanding of what code is and how it works, but not going so far as a full programming course. CS101 is an excellent first step for someone who then wants to take a full programming course.\n"}

You have probably heard that this is the era of \u201cBig Data\u201d. Stories about companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years. This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis. The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with their data analyses.Recommended Background\nSome familiarity with the R statistical programming language (http://www.r-project.org/) and proficiency in writing\nin English will be useful. At Johns Hopkins, this course is taken by first-year\ngraduate students in Biostatistics.Course Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos broken into 8-10 minute segments.\nThere will be two major data analysis projects that will be peer-graded\nwith instructor quality control. &nbsp;Course grades will be determined\nby the data analyses, peer reviews, and bonus points for answering questions\non the course message board.FAQ How is this course different from \u201cComputing for Data Analysis\u201d? This course will focus on how to plan, carry out, and communicate analyses of real data sets. While we will cover the basics of how to use R to implement these analyses, the course will not cover specific programming skills. Computing for Data Analysiswill cover some statistical programming topics that will be useful for this class, but it is not a prerequisite for the course. What resources will I need for this class? A computer with internet access on which the R software environment can be installed (recent Mac, Windows, or Linux computers are sufficient). Do I need to buy a textbook? There is no standard textbook for data analysis. The course lectures will include pointers to free resources about specific statistical methods, data sources, and other tools for data analysis. "}

This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.\nWeekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis\nof the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior\nsessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also\nbe a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.\nStudent Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:\n\"An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow students. I think getting the feedback from my peers was such a great way to run the course. So many ideas, suggestions, thoughts and words of encouragement that were so appreciated. I've been driving everyone I know talking about it all the time.\" &nbsp;--E.

The course\nwas brilliant, challenging and fun! Our professor, Prof. Karl Ulrich, is\nan amazing teacher, I loved his down to Earth approach. Participating in a tournament was also one of the course's highlights. The whole thing was a great, unforgettable experience.

Those with strong skills in visual expression (sketching, 3D modeling, model making) will find the design challenges easier than those who struggle a bit more with the mechanics of expressing an idea or building a prototype.\nStill, anyone with an interest in learning to be a designer (or to be a better designer) will be able to take this course. Indeed, the goal of the course is to reach both professionals as well as those who are just really interested in design. This is\ndefinitely not an engineering course. Although engineers who wish to become engineering designers will benefit from the course, this course will not include any specific domain knowledge in engineering (e.g., circuit design, design of structures, and\nso forth).Suggested Readings\nTo get a feel for the style of the instructor and the material in the course, this book is a good place to start: Ulrich, K.T. 2010.

The McGraw-Hill text (5th&nbsp;Edition) sells for $173 on Amazon, but the Coursera edition is $30 in eBook format. The eBook includes the chapters referenced in the course (e.g., Identifying Customer Needs, Generating Product Concepts, Selecting Product Concepts, Testing Product Concepts, and Prototyping). You do not need to purchase this text to complete this course. However, the text contains some more detailed instructions on tools and methods which you may find helpful both for this course and in your professional work.The PDF, found&nbsp;here, contains detailed instructions on how to purchase the text. &nbsp;However, in&nbsp;sum,&nbsp;you find it here and purchase in the normal ways. After purchase&nbsp;you may download the ebook to your own computer or read it on-line. (Reading a downloaded copy requires the VitalSource ebook reader. Instructions for that reader are also in the PDF.)\nCourse Format\nThe content is delivered via several 3-12 minutes videos created specifically for this course. The videos are typically explanations of concepts, and make liberal use of illustrative artifacts from many different domains (e.g., software, food, technology-based products, services, buildings). The videos are supplemented by readings from the free digital textbook&nbsp; Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society. Essentially all&nbsp;of the work for this course is DOING design. Each week will include a design challenge focused on a design problem of your own choosing. By the time you have completed the course, you will have stepped through a sequence of challenges that will result in the creation of&nbsp;a new artifact. FAQ Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. What resources will I need for this class? You will need some physical tools (e.g., marker, razor knife, straight edge, glue, and so forth). However, these tools are readily available for very little money.&nbsp; What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? You will learn a structured process to tackling unstructured challenges of all types.

Design Thinking is a popular new idea in the business world&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;organizations as diverse as&nbsp;entrepreneurial start-ups, big established corporations, and government and social service organizations are experimenting with Design Thinking as an alternative\napproach to traditional problem-solving. Accelerated by the spectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, Design Thinking is seen as offering a new approach better-suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many organizations\ntoday. But Design Thinking can remain mysterious for people interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.\nThough&nbsp;designing as a\ncraft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master,&nbsp;Design Thinking, as a problem solving\napproach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that\ncontains 4 questions and several tools:&nbsp; The 4 sequential questions that take us on a journey through an\nassessment of current reality (what is?),&nbsp;the envisioning of a new future (what\nif?), the development of some concepts for new business opportunities (what wows?), and the testing of some of\nthose in the marketplace (what works?).&nbsp;The process of Design Thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users for whom they would like to create value. They mostly do this through ethnographic methods, such as experience mapping, rather than traditional methods, such as focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and collect better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven. That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them, usually looking for the&nbsp;kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value propositions.\nAccompanying the 4 questions is a set of tools to help\nbusiness people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and\ngrowth that they bring to the rest of their business. In this course, we will\nlook at several stories from different organizations\n\u2013&nbsp;major&nbsp;corporations like&nbsp;IBM,\nentrepreneurial start-ups like&nbsp;MeYouHealth,\nand even social service organizations like&nbsp;The Good Kitchen&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;all\nusing the Design Thinking tools and approach to achieve better outcomes.Syllabus\nWeek 1: What is Design Thinking?&nbsp;We will begin our course by unpacking\nwhat we mean by Design Thinking and why it is more effective than traditional\nbusiness methods when the goal is innovation in the business environment. By looking at the case history of The Good Kitchen, a Denmark program for providing meals for\nthe elderly, we will explore how the mindset and practice of the innovation\nteam that partnered with innovation consultant Hatch &amp; Bloom enabled them\nto achieve innovation and growth. We\u2019ll conclude Week 1 by examining what\nkinds of problems and challenges are best suited for a Design Thinking\napproach.Week 2: How can we prepare ourselves to\nbe leaders of innovation? Design Thinking is not only about process and tools. It is about people as\nwell:&nbsp;about you as a design thinker\nand about the people you want to create value for and with. And so, before we jump\ninto the process of using Design Thinking to generate and test ideas, we want\nto first focus on your own mindset and look at whether your mind is prepared to both see and act\non opportunity when it shows up in your world. We will examine this issue by\nlooking at the stories of two very capable managers,&nbsp;George and Geoff,&nbsp;and how their differing mindsets affect their ability to lead innovation and\ngrowth. We\nwill also look at the role of visualization tools that use imagery and storytelling\nto bring ideas to life.\nWeek 3: How can you use Design Thinking\nto generate ideas?&nbsp;Now we will dive deeper into the Design Thinking process, looking at how we can\nuse it to generate better ideas. This week, we will look at the story of an\nentrepreneur, Chris Cartter, and his start-up,&nbsp;MeYouHealth, as they worked with\nBoston design firm, Essential Design, to understand the kind of\nopportunity that social networking might hold for helping us to improve our\nhealth.&nbsp;Examining\nwhat already exists is the first step in the Design Thinking process. As part\nof assessing what is,&nbsp;designers\n\u201cfollow the customer home\u201d and explore the problems they are trying to solve in\nlife versus their product use.&nbsp;Once they have thoroughly explored and\nlooked for patterns in what is, designers\nlook toward the future and ask what if?&nbsp;These two questions&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;what is and what\nif&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;along with their associated tools will\nbe the focus of Week 3. This is the creative part of the process, but it also\ncontains a disciplined approach.Week 4: How can you use Design Thinking\nto test ideas?&nbsp;Having generated all\nthese great ideas, what\u2019s next? The Design Thinking process now helps us to\ntake the many ideas we have generated and figure out how to determine which\nones are likely to produce the specific kinds of outcomes we want, whether these\ntake the form of improved nutrition for the elderly (The Good Kitchen), healthier lifestyle choices (MeYouHealth) or even more \u201chot leads\u201d emanating from your trade shows\n(in the&nbsp;IBM&nbsp;example we will look at this week). This week,\nwe will follow the activities of an IBM team&nbsp;working\nclosely with experience marketing agency&nbsp;George P. Johnson&nbsp;as they develop and test ideas for a revolutionary\napproach to trade show participation. This process begins by asking what wows?&nbsp;This question brings together\nthe customer and business cases supporting our new concepts. Typically, the\n\u201cwow\u201d zone occurs at the intersection of three criteria: somebody wants it, we\ncan create and deliver it, and doing so has the potential to produce the\noutcomes we as an organization want.&nbsp;Then\nwe ask&nbsp;what works? and conduct small experiments to test if our assumptions\nare accurate. We'll conclude the week by reviewing what we have covered.Recommended Background\nAnyone interested in\ninnovation in an organizational context would benefit from this class.

Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet.

Topics covered: anatomy, eating, locomotion, growth, environmental and behavioral adaptations, origins and extinction. Lessons are delivered from museums, fossil-preparation labs and dig sites. Estimated workload: 3-5 hrs/week. In Dino 101: Dinosaur Paleobiology, students will learn about the many kinds of non-avian dinosaurs that roamed the earth during the Mesozoic Era, from 250 to 65 million years ago. Numerous topics are covered in order to deliver a comprehensive survey of this important group of animals. These include&nbsp;adaptations for&nbsp;attack and defence,&nbsp;anatomy,&nbsp;&nbsp;appearances, behaviors, birth, deep time, evolutionary theory, feeding, fossilization, growth, integumentary structures, locomotion, major groupings, origins, paleogeography, plate tectonics, reproduction, species definition, stratigraphy,&nbsp;and the extinction event&nbsp;that brought their dominance to an end.Course material is delivered in a student-friendly short-form fashion, with numerous formative feedback sections. Many lessons are delivered from actual dinosaur dig sites. Students will gain access to a number of special interactive modules designed specifically for this course. These modules will grant users access to their very own virtual fossil collection, allow them to build dinosaur skeletons and provide them with an interactive visual representation of geologic time. This course's unique lesson delivery, combined with a classic quiz structure, will enable students to quickly gain a solid foundation for understanding dinosaurs, their adaptations and behaviours, and their place in the long history of earth.Dino 101 is part of an ongoing program of research into digital learning conducted by the University of Alberta and therefore anonymized data provided by Coursera and survey information can be made accessible to the researchers.Syllabus\nWeek 1: \u201cAppearances and Anatomy\u201d covers the diversity in dinosaur appearances, and will be able to identify major features of the major groups of dinosaurs.\nWeek 2: \u201cDeath and Fossilization\u201d describes how fossils form, how we interpret the taphonomy of skeletons and bonebeds, and looks at the possible biases taphonomic events may create in the fossil record.\nWeek 3: \u201cEating\u201d looks at the variety of food types, feeding habits, and feeding adaptations amongst the major groups of dinosaurs\nWeek 4: \u201cMoving Around\u201d helps students understand the general modes and styles of locomotion in the major dinosaur groups. The lesson also describes general methods of evaluating hypotheses on locomotion.\nWeek 5: \u201cBirth, Growth, Reproduction\u201d provides a generalized life history of a dinosaur, from birth through adulthood, including reproduction.

The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the \u201cdigital revolution\u201d that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability. In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.Syllabus\nBroad outline of the topics covered in the class:\u00a0\nIntroduction: What is signal processing, history of the topic, application examples.Discrete-time (DT) signals: the discrete-time complex exponential, and a computer music synthesis example.Euclid and Hilbert: Signal processing as geometry, vectors spaces, bases, approximations.Fourier Analysis: The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and series (DFS). The discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT). Examples. The fast Fourier transform algorithm (FFT).Linear Filters: Linear time-invariant systems, convolution, ideal and realizable filters. Filter design and implementation, examples.Interpolation and Sampling: Continuous-time (CT) signals, interpolation, sampling. The sampling theorem as orthonormal basis expansion. Processing of CT signals in DT.Stochastic Signal Processing and Quantization: Stochastic signals, quantization, analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) conversion.Image Processing: Introduction to image processing and two-dimensional (2D) Fourier analysis. Filtering and compression. The JPEG compression standard.Digital Communication Systems: Analog channels and bandwidth/power constraints. Modulation and demodulation. Transmitter and receiver design. ADSL.Recommended Background\nFundamentals of linear algebra and calculus are a must. Familiarity with probability theory and system theory are highly recommended. Familiarity with Matlab (or equivalent) and/or scientific programming are a plus.Suggested Readings\nA companion textbook is available both in printed format and electronically on the web (free of charge). Please refer to www.sp4comm.org for details. Many more bibliographical references can be found in the textbook.Course Format\nThe class will consist of videolectures, each approximately 45 minutes in length; videos will contain some interactive quiz questions. Students are encouraged to implement many of the course topics in the programming language of their choice; worked out examples in Matlab-compatible code will be provided on a weekly basis. The final grade will be based on the students' performance in weekly homework sets, which will include applied coding problems.FAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nThe basic material (textbook, slides, videos) will available on the web. Programming exercises are mostly language-independent; numerical problems can be solved using Octave (free software) or Matlab (commercial software).\nWhat is so cool about digital signal processing?\nIn the old days, i.e. the days of discrete electronics, if you wanted to build a circuit as a practical application of the theory you had studied, you had to shop for components, solder them together, and then repeat the process when a mistake led to a burn out -- a very common occurrence. With DSP, as long as you have a PC, you have a portable and indestructible lab in which you can quickly assemble prototypes of your favorite circuits, from guitar effects to data communication systems. In this class, you will learn how to do all that!\nIs this class about DSP chips?\nIn short, no. DSP chips are specialized microprocessors designed to perform very efficiently the set of operations that are most common in digital signal processing. Many DSP chips exist and there is a rich body of literature on DSP chip programming. However, in this class we will deal with the fundamentals of signal processing in more abstract terms, and focus less on the specifics of a particular implementation strategy. The reward will be a very flexible toolset that is very easy to apply to your preferred architecture, be it a DSP chip or a standard PC.\n"}

Young children learn many of these skills through the interactions they have with their teachers. This course is intended to increase teachers\u2019 knowledge about specific types of teacher-child interactions that promote young children\u2019s development. The course will focus on helping teachers to offer emotionally supportive interactions to the children in their care. When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day that makes a difference in children\u2019s lives, there\u2019s clear evidence that it\u2019s the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most important.\u00a0 And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions that lead to children\u2019s development and learning.\u00a0 So this course focuses on those interactions.\u00a0 By the end of the course, you should have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that foster learning and development among your students. Although there are many types of interactions that are critical to\nyoung children\u2019s development, this course will focus on one area in particular\n\u2013 Emotional Support. This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the\nfoundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are\nEmotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and\nexcited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know\nthat, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.\nWhat do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge \u2013 knowledge about children\u2019s development, about the content they\u2019re teaching, about effective teaching practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms, and about themselves. In this course we\u2019ll focus a bit on knowledge about children\u2019s development and we\u2019ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and development.\nAnother part of effective teaching is seeing. All the knowledge in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like \u2013 in lots of different types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers tell us they don\u2019t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get them. We\u2019ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom videos and we\u2019ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.\nUltimately we can\u2019t learn to be an effective teacher without practice \u2013 we need to spend some time doing \u2013 enacting the teaching practices that we\u2019ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really learn about them \u2013 you need to spend some time practicing the types of interactions we\u2019ll be talking about.\nThere\u2019s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective\u00a0 teachers spend time reflecting on their practice. We think of this a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying glass \u2013 we\u2019ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have learned throughout this course.\nMuch of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System \u2013 or CLASS(\u2122). CLASS is an observational measure used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to increase the effectiveness of teachers' interactions with young children.\u00a0\u00a0 ********************************************************************* The development of the course was funded, in part, by the\nInstitute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant\nR305A100154-11 to the University of Virginia.\u00a0\nThe opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent\nviews of the U.S. Department of Education.\u00a0Syllabus\nWeek One \u2013 Creating Emotionally Supportive\nClassrooms: We\u2019ll take a closer look at the importance of interactions and the\npower that teachers have in the development of young children. This week will\ninclude an overview of the areas and dimensions of the Teaching through\nInteractions Framework. For this course, we\u2019ll focus specifically on the area\nof Emotional Support.\n\u00a0\nWeek Two \u2013 Building Positive Relationships\nwith Children \u2013 The dimension of Positive Climate: This week will focus on the\nfirst dimension of Emotional Support \u2013 Positive Climate. You\u2019ll learn about the\nimportance of Positive Climate, see examples of real teachers as they\ndemonstrate effective Positive Climate interactions with their students, and get\na chance to analyze what you\u2019re seeing.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity", "cat": "9/humanities|13/physics", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 197, "desc": "This course offers you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the life and work of the young Albert Einstein and especially his mind-bending special theory of relativity. In this course we will seek to \u201cunderstand Einstein,\u201d especially focusing\non the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old\npatent clerk, introduced in his so-called \u201cmiracle year\u201d of 1905. Our goal\nwill be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations\nof relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein\nthe person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his\ntheory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein\ncome up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the\nmeaning of relativity? What\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d about the special theory of relativity?\nWhy did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean\nto say that time is the \u201cfourth dimension\u201d? Can time actually run more\nslowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending\non their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can\u2019t things\ntravel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the\ncenter of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence\nthat definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why\ndidn\u2019t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\nStudents may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative\napproach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more\nquantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more\nqualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young\nEinstein and/or the special theory of relativity.\nSyllabus\nWeek One (Einstein in Context): Einstein quotes of the week; a thought\nexperiment involving relativity; physics and Einstein circa 1900.\nWeek Two (Events, Clocks, and Reference Frames): Einstein quotes\nof the week; synchronizing clocks; the famous June 1905 paper; thinking\nmore deeply about events and observers; understanding inertial frames of\nreference; spacetime diagrams; the Galilean transformation; Einstein's\nstarting point: the two postulates.\nWeek Three (Ethereal Problems and Solutions): Einstein quotes of\nthe week; a few words about waves; the luminiferous ether; the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment vs. stellar aberration; how do you solve a problem like the\nether?; the solutions of Fitzgerald, Lorentz, Poincare, and Einstein.\nWeek Four (The Weirdness Begins): Einstein quotes of the week; the\nlight constancy principle; time and length are suspect; what isn't suspect;\nexploring the Lorentz factor; the miracle of the muon.\nWeek Five (Spacetime Switching): Einstein quotes of the week; the\nLorentz transformation; leading clocks lag; the ultimate speed limit.\nWeek Six (Breaking the Spacetime Speed Limit?): Einstein quotes\nof the week; spacetime diagrams revisited; regions of spacetime; cause\nand effect, or vice versa?; faster than light paradoxes.\nWeek Seven (Paradoxes to Ponder): Einstein quotes of the week;\nthe pole-in-the-barn paradox; the spaceships-on-a-rope paradox; how length\ncontraction actually works; the twin paradox.\nWeek Eight (To the Center of the Galaxy and Back): Einstein quotes\nof the week; traveling the galaxy in one lifetime; the reception of relativity;\nEinstein's Nobel Prize and the nature of genius; relativity beyond science.\nRecommended Background\nNo prior knowledge is required. Anyone who is willing to engage with the\nmaterial is welcome. (For students choosing the more quantitative approach,\na familiarity with basic algebra will be helpful. But a brief math review\nwill be provided.)\nSuggested Readings\nAlthough the course is designed to be self-contained, it is recommended\n(but not required) that you read the following profile: \"Young Einstein:\nFrom the Doxerl Affair to the Miracle Year,\" by L. Randles Lagerstrom,\navailable for US$2.99 from Amazon Direct Publishing (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BKKHS4U).\nYou may also download the free software for viewing it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000493771. (Versions\nare available for PCs, Macs, tablets, and smart phones.)\nCourse Format\nStudents may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative\napproach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more\nquantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more\nqualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young\nEinstein and/or the special theory of relativity. (Students who choose\nthe quantitative approach may also do a creative project if they wish.)\nThe more quantitative approach is designed for those students who desire\nthe deepest understanding of the special theory of relativity (within the\nintroductory context of this course). Although one can gain a good understanding\nof the theory via a qualitative approach, the theory is ultimately a mathematical\ntheory. The mathematics required, however, is not advanced. A familiarity\nwith basic algebra will suffice. (For those whose knowledge is rusty, a\nreview of the math needed is provided in a video clip.) The primary assignments\nfor students who take this approach will be to watch lecture videos each\nweek, take an assessment quiz for each video, take a weekly review quiz,\nand work on weekly problem sets.\nThe more qualitative approach is designed for those students who desire\na deeper understanding of Einstein and the special theory of relativity,\nfocusing on the concepts and results. The primary assignments for students\nwho take this approach will be to watch lecture videos each week, take\nan assessment quiz for each video, and take a weekly review quiz. (Though\nthe videos will cover quantitative aspects of the theory, the quizzes will\nfocus on the concepts and results.) Students will also complete a creative\nproject relating to the young Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity\n(e.g., a video, poem, musical piece, artwork, animation, etc.). The creative\nproject may be instructional, humorous, serious, or dramatic, or some combination\nthereof. Further guidelines will be given in a later handout.\nThe auditing approach is designed for those students who want to learn\nmore about Einstein and the special theory of relativity, but may not want\nto complete all the assignments in one of the other approaches.\nFAQ Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. What resources will I need for this class? For this course, all you need is an Internet connection and the willingness to think. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nLearning how an unknown patent clerk came up with the special theory of relativity is certainly a fascinating story. And there are many cool things we will learn that come out of the theory itself, such as that one person can age significantly more slowly than another, that it's possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and back in one lifetime, and that time travel into the future is possible. But perhaps the coolest thing is simply to learn more about, in Einstein's words, \"the mystery ... of the marvelous structure of reality.\"\n"}

The\nCommon Law of England and Wales is one of the major global\nlegal traditions. In order to understand the common law, we need to deal with\nits history, and the development of its characteristic institutions like the\njury, judge made law, parliamentary sovereignty and due process. We also need\nto ask some critical questions. What role does democracy\nplay in the development of the common law? To what extent are human rights\ncentral to the modern common law? How does the common law of England and Wales\nrelate to the law of the European Union? Answering these questions will give us\ninsights into the current challenges the law faces\nand its possible futures.Syllabus\nWeek\nOne: Dead Kings and Presidents: A Brief History\nof the Common Law\nWeek Two: See You In Court: The Court System and the Common LawWeek\nThree: Supreme Power: Parliamentary Sovereignty and Law\nMaking Week Four: Wigs and Pens: Judicial Law Making and the doctrine of Precedent Week Five: Reading the Riot Act: How Statutes are Interpreted Week Six: After the War, Before the Peace: The European Union and Human RightsRecommended Background\nThis\ncourse does not require any existing legal knowledge.Course Format\nThe\ncourse is designed to be flexible to how people want to learn.

People will be able to go through the course at their own\npace.FAQ\nWhat is Common Law?&nbsp;\nHistorically\nthe common law originated in England in the Kings Courts and emerged from the\nKings Judges who travelled round the country adopting what they considered to\nbe the best legal rules from each area. The common law has\ndeveloped through judicial decisions in cases that articulate principles\nand rules, but one must bear in mind the important role that Parliament plays\nin enacting statutory laws. .Indeed, in UK common law Parliament is seen as the\nsovereign law making power. A robust understanding of the common law also\nrequires some knowledge of its distinctive institutions and ideas such as the\njury, due process and the centrality of the judge to the trial. . Will this cover other jurisdictions?\nEnglish\nCommon Law underpins the law in many jurisdictions which in turn have\ncontributed to the evolution of the common law.\nWill this course count towards the study\nof a qualifying law degree?\nNo.\nMost jurisdictions will have their own rules regarding what is required to\nqualify as a solicitor or a barrister and you should refer to the appropriate\nbodies in the country where you wish to practice.\nWhere can I find out about more\ninformation regarding this subject and the University of London programmes?\nThe content of this\ncourse is drawn from the extensive world renowned portfolio of flexible study\nprogrammes offered through the University of London International\nProgrammes.&nbsp; These programmes result from a collaboration between the\nUniversity of London International Academy and 12 Colleges of the University of\nLondon. &nbsp;Established in 1858, the International Programmes is the world\u2019s\noldest provider of flexible learning.

In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.After we\u2019ve covered the basics,&nbsp;we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we\u2019ll be talking about vaccination too. We\u2019ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology.&nbsp;And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.&nbsp;We're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!Syllabus\nThis course will cover key concepts that relate to the emergence, the spread, and the control of infectious disease epidemics.We'll cover various broad topics, including:The basics: history of infectious diseases, basic concepts of disease dynamics, parasite diversity, evolution & ecology of infectious diseasesEmergence of diseases: The basic reproductive number, critical community size, epidemic curve, zoonoses, spill over, human / wildlife interface, climate change, hot zones, pathologySpread of diseases: transmission types (droplets, vectors, sex), superspreading, diffusion, social networks, nosomical transmission, manipulation of behaviorControl of diseases: drug resistance, vaccination, herd immunity, quarantines, antibiotics, antivirals, health communication, ethical challenges of disease controlThe future of infectious diseases:\nEvolution of virulence, emergence of drug resistance, eradication of diseases, medicine & evolution, crop diseases & food security, digital epidemiologyRecommended Background\nNo background is required; all are welcome.Suggested Readings\nWe will provide you with links to relevant scientific articles in the field that are freely available as open access articles.

This is achieved by epigenetic control of gene expression; the switching on and switching off of genes. This course will cover the principles of epigenetic control of gene expression, how epigenetic control contributes to cellular differentiation and development, and how it goes wrong in disease. While the human genome sequence has\ntransformed our understanding of human biology, it isn\u2019t just the sequence of\nyour DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated\nand others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics. \u00a0\nEpigenetics has been a hot topic for research\nover the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control\ncontributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable\nthrough cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to\nmutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,\nepigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be\nmanipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that\nepigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),\nwhich has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\nThis course will give an introduction to the\nfundamentals of epigenetic control.

Quantum\nphysics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework\nfor understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,\nand makes possible the most precise measurements ever made.&nbsp; More than just a theory, it offers a way of\nlooking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.&nbsp; Our course will provide some of that practice and teach you \"tricks of the trade\" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject at a deeper level.\nThe\nbasic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to\nastonishing outcomes. &nbsp;Two examples that\nwe will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by\nAlbert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.&nbsp; Both of these predictions came from very\nsimple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science\nand society.&nbsp; Another familiar\nphenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent\nof quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made\npossible the discovery in the 1980\u2019s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.&nbsp; However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are\nareas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of\nultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of \u201cExploring\nQuantum Physics\u201d.\nRichard\nFeynman once said, \u201cI think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum\nmechanics.\u201d&nbsp; We say, that\u2019s no reason not\nto try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the \u201cspooky\u201d phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines\na spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational\nperplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was\nwrong.&nbsp; This is what makes it such an\nexciting area of science!Syllabus\nLecture 1: Introduction to quantum mechanics.

The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System.&nbsp;Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World", "cat": "9/humanities", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 210, "desc": "We understand the world \u2014 and our selves \u2014 through stories. Then some of those hopes and fears become the world. Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of\nhumanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and\noften shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale\nto kiddie lit to myth; from \"Cinderella\" to Alice in Wonderland to Superman;\nfrom building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole\nsocieties. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent\nneeds and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself\nin many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy\ngodmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical\nviewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,\nfrom Frankenstein to Avatar, is the most important in our modern\nworld because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound\nways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,\nshape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will\nexplore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art\nand as insights into ourselves and our world.\nWork Expectations\nFor further information about the coursework, please see the Work Expectations page.Syllabus\nThis course comprises ten units. Each will include a significant reading, typically a novel or a selection of shorter works. I will offer video discussions of each of the readings and also of more general topics in art and psychology that those readings help illuminate. Each unit will include online quizzes and ask you to write a brief essay offering your own insights into the reading. In order, the units are:\nGrimm \u2014 Children's and Household Tales\nCarroll \u2014 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\nStoker \u2014 Dracula\nShelley \u2014 Frankenstein\nHawthorne & Poe \u2014 Stories and Poems\nWells \u2014 The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Invisible Man, \"The Country of the Blind,\" \"The Star\"\nBurroughs & Gilman \u2014 A Princess of Mars & Herland\nBradbury \u2014 The Martian Chronicles\nLeGuin \u2014 The Left Hand of Darkness\nDoctorow \u2014 Little Brother\nIn Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne's \"The Birthmark,\" \"Rappaccini's Daughter,\" \"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,\" and \"The Artist of the Beautiful\"; Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" \"The Black Cat,\" \"The Oval Portrait,\" \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,\" \"The Bells,\" \"The Raven,\" \"Annabel Lee.\" All the readings except Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles and Ursula K. LeGuin's The Left Hand of Darkness will be available online at no charge.Recommended Background\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. \u00a0However, the course\nwill be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students.\n\u00a0Therefore, for all participants, reading comfortably in English at\nthe undergraduate college level is desirable. \u00a0For those also participating\nin the writing and written responses, which is recommended, some experience\nin writing about literature is desirable.\u00a0(A Note on Reading in Translation.)Suggested Readings\nI do not ask participants in this course to use any specific editions. However, for some works I believe some editions are better than others. For example, some editions of The Island of Dr. Moreau omit Charles Edward Prendick's \"Introduction\"; however, since that \"Introduction\" was actually written by H. G. Wells and included in the original publication of the book, it should not be omitted. For some works, I believe that a printed text is preferable. For example, the paper versions of Alice in Wonderland printed with Through the Looking-Glass along with James Tenniel's illustrations for both give one a sense of Lewis Carroll's original intent and design. The University of Adelaide's eBooks@Adelaide site makes available both Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glasswith Tenniel's illustrations placed approximately where they were in the original text, although the chapters themselves are not broken into pages. Thus that online edition, for many people, is a reasonable although not exact substitute for the printed book. For those who choose to use online editions in this course, links for the currently available ones that I would suggest are listed below. Grimm \u2014 Children's and Household Tales (Lucy Crane translation with Walter Crane illustrations)\nCarroll \u2014 Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\nStoker \u2014 Dracula (This reading is somewhat longer than most of the others. You may want to begin it in advance.)\nShelley \u2014 Frankenstein\nHawthorne & Poe \u2014 Stories and Poems (Hawthorne's Mosses from an Old Manse includes \"The Birthmark,\" \"Rappaccini's Daughter,\" and \"The Artist of the Beautiful\" and his Twice-Told Tales includes \"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment\"; The Portable Poe includes all the suggested Poe stories and poems\nWells \u2014 The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Invisible Man, \"The Country of the Blind,\" \"The Star\"\nBurroughs & Gilman \u2014 A Princess of Mars & Herland\nBradbury \u2014 The Martian Chronicles (not available for legal, free download)\nLeGuin \u2014 The Left Hand of Darkness (not available for legal, free download)\nDoctorow \u2014 Little Brother (This reading is somewhat longer than most of the others. You may want to begin it in advance.)\nIn whatever form, I hope you enjoy your reading! Reading Advice\nShould you read the works for this course as they come up each week or in advance? Different people work best different ways. I like to read slowly, underline, write in the margins, and make up an index to a work when I've finished reading it. For me reading in advance often works nicely because I can, just before the moment when I need to discuss the work, review the underlinings and the index to fully refresh my memory and get an overview of the work. For other people, particularly those who don't take extensive notes, reading quite close to the moment of discussion or of writing about the work is crucial. I think individuals will need to judge for themselves which way to read for this course.Course Format\nThis course includes an introductory unit of video clips discussing how one should proceed plus ten content units. \u00a0Each content unit asks for the reading of a book or book-length selection of writings in the field of fantasy and science fiction and offers the chance to write a brief essay about that unit\u2019s reading and to comment on the writing of four other participants. \u00a0Each content unit begins with a video clip with some advice about that unit\u2019s reading and later provides a series of clips, totaling about 1 1/2 hours, discussing both the unit\u2019s reading and general matters that that reading helps explore. \u00a0The course also offers an enrichment quiz (ungraded) for each unit and an on-going forum for participant discussion. \u00a0That forum will be monitored and may stimulate the creation of a supplementary clip or two per unit. \u00a0If any participant desires a grade, the grade will be determined by the quality and quantity of the writing and responses to the writing of others.FAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nFor this course, all you need is an Internet connection, copies of the texts (most of which can be obtained for free), and the time to read, write, discuss, and enjoy some marvelous literature.\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nIn addition to dealing with some terrific fiction, this course aims to help everyone think more imaginatively, read more deeply, and write more powerfully.\n"}

Plenty of practice opportunities are included! The Beginning Game\nProgramming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games\nusing the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java,\nActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First,\nusing C# lets us use the Microsoft XNA and open-source MonoGame frameworks,\nwhich help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS, and\nothers. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game\ndevelopers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity\nenvironment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to\nprogram.\nThat learning how to program\ncomment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming\nexperience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the\nvery beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the\nend of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts\nthat apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also\nlearn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the\nentities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and\nsimple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.\nComputer programming is really fun in general,\nand programming games is even better!Syllabus\nWeek One: Introduction to the course, the Visual Studio environment, and the Microsoft XNA framework. Writing your first C# program and starting to learn about data types.Student Work: Programming Assignment 1 Week Two: Classes and objects, the core of object-oriented programming (which works great for games!). Writing your first XNA programs.Student Work: Programming Assignment 2, Programming Assignment 1 Peer EvaluationWeek Three: Strings and what we can do with them.

Keyboard input and text output in XNA.Student Work: Project Increment 5, Project Increment 4 Peer EvaluationWeek Twelve: The optional project as a great way to review for the Final Exam.Student Work: Final Exam, Project Increment 5 Peer EvaluationRecommended Background\nNo previous programming experience required; all are welcome!Suggested Readings\nI strongly recommend (but don't require) that you\npurchase Beginning C# Programming with XNA Game Studio by A.T. Chamillard\n(that's me). It's available as an ebook from Kobo, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon (free eReaders are readily available for the PC and Mac).\nThe book covers the course\nmaterial in much more depth than the lectures can and it can serve as a very\nuseful reference as you complete the programming assignments and the project. You\ncan, however, make it through the course without the book by spending more time\nreferencing free online resources, so it's up to you to make a cost/time tradeoff\ndecision based on your personal situation.Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos that will generally be less than 15 minutes long. Most lecture videos will contain numerous integrated quiz questions. The required assignments include 6 programming assignments and a small game project you'll develop in 5 increments. There's also a final exam for the course.Optional activities include numerous small programming labs throughout the course and another small game project in the final week of the course to solidify the course concepts and help you prepare for the final exam. In addition, there's also an optional game you can play on your computer to help motivate you to do the course work.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nStudents earning a 70% or above will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nFor this course, you'll need to install the free Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express environment and the free Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh framework. Although the ebook is strongly recommended, you can complete the course without it by spending\nextra time using online resources. And, of course, you'll need time, motivation, and brain power!\nCan I use a Mac or Linux for the class?\nThe default development environment for the programming in the course -- Visual C# 2010 Express and XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh -- is definitely for Windows, so if you can boot into Windows you should use the default environment. If not, though, Mac and Linux users can use MonoDevelop and MonoGame to do all the course work. I provide all the course materials for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users.\nWhat if I Can't Install XNA with Windows 8?\nSome people have run into compatibility issues when trying to install XNA on a Windows 8 machine. If you&nbsp; run into that problem, check out the steps here.\nOne of my Coursera students also discovered this link -- http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient -- which I haven't tried, but it is another option.\nWhat's the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nContrary to pop culture stereotypes, programming is pretty cool on its own. Even better, though, you'll be learning to program games!\n"}

This course will teach you the mechanisms of gamification, why it has such tremendous potential, and how to use it effectively. Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game contexts, such as business, education, and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of modern times because they powerfully motivate behavior. Game mechanics can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves, to create engaging experiences as well as assign rewards and recognition. Over the past few years, gamification adoption has skyrocketed. Companies use game thinking for employee motivation in human resources, team building, productivity enhancement, training, health and wellness, sustainability, and innovation. Marketers gamify their programs to engage customers. Organizations apply gamification to motivate&nbsp;crowdsourcing participants. Governments, non-profits, and educational institutions are also applying these techniques. Game thinking means more than dropping in badges and leaderboards to make an activity fun or addicting. It requires a thoughtful understanding of motivational psychology and game design techniques, as well as a sensitivity to limits and dangers. This course teaches learners the foundations to make gamification effective in any context. Subtitles for&nbsp;all video lectures available in: English,&nbsp;Russian (provided by&nbsp;Digital October), Turkish (Koc University), and Ukrainian (provided by Bionic University)\nSyllabus\nThe course is divided into 12 units. We will cover 2 of them each week: 1. What is Gamification?\n2. Games\n3. Game Thinking\n4. Game Elements\n5. Psychology and Motivation (I)\n6. Psychology and Motivation (II)\n7. Gamification Design Framework\n8. Design Choices\n9. Enterprise Gamification\n10. Social Good and Behavior Change\n11. Critiques and Risks\n12. Beyond the Basics\nRecommended Background\nKevin Werbach &amp; Dan Hunter,&nbsp;For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business&nbsp;(Wharton Digital Press, 2012)Kevin Werbach &amp; Dan Hunter,&nbsp;The Gamification Toolkit (Wharton Digital Press, forthcoming 2015)This course is designed as an introduction to gamification as a business practice. No particular technical knowledge or prior coursework are required.Suggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained. For those seeking additional background material, the version of the syllabus on the course website will link to suggested resources keyed to the course units. &nbsp;Professor Werbach\u2019s books, For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business&nbsp;and The Gamification Toolkit,&nbsp;which go into greater detail on the topics of the course, is available in ebook and paperback formats worldwide. &nbsp;Course Format\nThe class will consist of video lectures, which are between 7 and 12 minutes in length. Many of them contain integrated quiz questions. 2 units of lectures will be posted each week; you can watch them any time after that. &nbsp;There are also standalone\nmultiple-choice homework assignments for most weeks of the course (5-10 questions per week), and three short peer-graded written assignments involving realistic gamification scenarios. &nbsp;The course ends with a multiple-choice final exam.FAQ\n\u2022 Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment or Verified Certificate&nbsp;after completing the course?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the course above a threshold score will receive a Statement of Accomplishment or Verified Certificate signed by the instructor. \u2022 Who should take this course?\nAnyone curious about games and gamification more generally. That might include: business students, tech and engineering professionals, visual art and game designers, or other related fields; employees at companies that can apply gamification to their business; technologists or entrepreneurs seeking to incorporate gamification into their projects; game creators wondering about business or social impact applications; investors investigating the financial potential of the games industry; instructors studying gamification in education; video game aficionados excited about the deeper potential of games; or anyone seeking to expand their understanding of an exciting new field. \u2022 What resources will I need?\nNothing, other than the ability to access the Coursera website and other sites on Internet. The lecture videos, homeworks, and exam will sometimes direct you to investigate a website or view a video for further information. You might even be asked to\nplay a game or two.&nbsp;If you want additional support material for the course, I encourage you to purchase my book,&nbsp;For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business, which many students find to be a useful companion text. \u2022 What does a typical class session look like?\nIn most of the lecture segments, I describe topic concepts and illustrate them with gamification examples, screenshots, and diagrams. I often use real-world case-studies as illustrations. In a few of the segments, I interview leading gamification experts, executives, and investors. \u2022 Is the course gamified?\nNo, not in the sense of having points and badges associated with course activities. Given the novelty of the course and the massive open online format, I didn\u2019t feel I could implement a gamified system that was technically feasible and supportive of the\nlearning experience in the available timeframe. Gamification isn\u2019t a solution for everything, and it\u2019s not always easy to do well! That being said, in the course I\u2019ll discuss examples of educators using gamification in effective ways. And there just might\nbe a game-like aspect or two of the lectures. \u2022 What will I learn from this course?\nThat\u2019s largely up to you! The course provides a solid introduction to the concepts and practices of gamification, which can be applied in a number of ways. You\u2019ll be able to think about applying gamification to your business or your life, and to connect\ngamification with other fields such as marketing, strategy, IT, psychology, and design. And hopefully you\u2019ll see video games in a whole new light.\n\u2022 Is this course different than the prior sessions Gamification on Coursera?\nThis is another session of the same course. &nbsp;It has been revised to correct errors and&nbsp;update information, but it covers the same material as the earlier sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nFor more information on Penn\u2019s Open Learning initiative, please go to:http://openlearning.upenn.edu"}

In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better\nunderstand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances in\nbiotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.\nWe will begin with some of the most basic issues\nof genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them\nis processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then we\u2019ll see that much\nof the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's\nnot much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome\nI\u2019d see that they are 98.5% identical. It\u2019s that 1.5% difference that we study to\ndetermine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.&nbsp; In the next few years you\u2019ll be able\nto get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the\nchallenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall\nparticularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice\nand others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex\nunfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment. Thanks in large part to genomics we are\nbeginning to understand the living processes that constitute ourselves, where\nwe can begin to intervene to take control of our own future. We will look at\nthe technologies involved and the consequences of this new power. Genetic\nengineering has already changed what you eat and the medicines you take, and will\nlikely therefore change how long you live. If we choose to genetically engineer\nourselves as some advocate then we may also change how we view ourselves as\nhuman beings. We do not know where our ability to intervene in our own living\nprocesses is going to lead us. Depending on your point of view that is the\npromise or the threat of the era we live in.

Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at Duke University. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology. &nbsp;We often hear about new \"genome sequences,\" commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found \"genetic evidence for natural selection.\"&nbsp; This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology. &nbsp;No prior coursework is assumed.Syllabus\nEvidence for evolution\nIntroduction to basic genetics\nRecombination and genetic mapping simple traits\nComplications to genetic mapping\nGenes vs. environment\nBasic population genetics and Hardy-Weinberg\nGene flow, differentiation, inbreeding\nNatural selection and genetic drift\nMolecular evolutionAdaptive behaviors and sexual selectionSpecies formation and phylogenetics\nEvolutionary applications and misapplications\nRecommended Background\nNo prior coursework in the subject is assumed. It would be helpful for the application of some concepts to have a working knowledge of High School level math, including basic algebra. While useful for solving the assigned problems, this is not essential to understand and follow the general concepts and otherwise enjoy the class.Suggested Readings\nAlthough the class is largely self-contained, students wanting reinforcement on some of the lecture topics and/ or to expand their knowledge beyond what we cover in class can find a compelling treatment of the evidence for evolution (as well as related\ntopics) in this short book: Coyne, Jerry. 2009. Why Evolution Is True For assistance with the genetics and more in-depth evolutionary concepts, these textbooks may be helpful as a supplements to the lectures: Griffiths, Anthony, et al. 2010. Introduction to Genetic Analysis Freeman, Scott, and John Herron. 2013. Evolutionary Analysis Various alternative freely available readings will be specified in the course as well.\nFinally, if you have an iOS device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch), we recommend this free app, specifically designed to be a supplement to the course and written in part by a former Coursera student in the course:\nGenetics and Evolution app\nUse of this app is NOT required, however-- it's simply a supplemental tool that can help by allowing you to simulate concepts, test yourself on terms, generate practice problems, and solve some kinds of problems used in the course.\nCourse Format\nThe class will consist of watching multiple lecture mini-videos which are mostly 10-20 minutes in length. &nbsp;These sometimes contain 1-3 integrated quiz questions per video. &nbsp;There will also be 2 test assessments, including a non-cumulative final exam.FAQ\nWhat background in biology is needed for this course?\nThe course does not assume any college-level background in biology. A few introductory genetics topics are covered somewhat quickly, such that those who did not learn basic heredity in grade-school may struggle with the pace, but students who had literally no biology have succeeded in understanding the material from just this treatment and a little bit of internet searching.\nWhat if I don't believe in evolution? What if it conflicts with my faith?\nThe course presents evidence for evolution in the first lecture, and delves into extensive detail on evolutionary processes later. Enrolled parties need not in any way modify or abandon their belief system, but test questions will be based on the material as it is covered in the lectures.\nWill the lectures cover macroevolution, or talk about the diversity of past (e.g., dinosaurs) or present life?\nThe present version does not cover macroevolution or the diversity of life. There will not be anything about dinosaurs. The evolution topics covered in the present course are largely confined to \"microevolution,\" though we will consider adding some new topics spanning macroevolution to future course iterations.\nWill the lectures cover any molecular biology, or applications like PCR or next-generation DNA sequencing?\nNo. The genetics lectures are limited to basic transmission genetics, recombination, genetic mapping, and basic quantitative genetics. Please see other courses for these topics.\nWill the lectures discuss human cloning or the use of embryonic or pluripotent stem cells?\nNo.\nI've taken past iterations of this course-- has it changed?\nThere are a few new videos and a few other edits since the 1st &amp; 2nd iterations. The content is basically identical to the 3rd (2014) iteration.Does Prof. Mohamed Noor ALWAYS talk that fast?\nYes.\n"}

You will gain insight into how challenges have changed over time, we will discuss the likely determinants of such changes and examine future projections. Successful international strategies and programs promoting human health will be highlighted and global health governance structures will be mapped and the role of the key actors explored. The course takes its starting point in the belief that good health is intimately linked with personal happiness, productivity, the economic and social development of nations and the advancement of people. Globalization processes influence the health of individuals, societies and the function of health systems in many ways and may present opportunities but may also pose a risk to vulnerable societies. Throughout this course presentations will transcend the perspectives of individual countries and will critically discuss how global mega-trends and different sectors of society influence the health of population. Transition in health and the drivers of such transition will be core elements of this course.&nbsp; During the four first course weeks we will explore a range of themes, including: communicable and non-communicable diseases, environmental health, child health, reproductive health and rights, and health among refugees and displaced populations. We focus on the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable disease experienced by much of the world\u2019s population today.As the deadline for meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG\u2019s) nears, course participants will also reflect on the post-MDG agenda by exploring the future of global health and trends in technical innovation, global strategies and programs in the fight for better health. Through lectures, readings, and assignments, course participants will be asked to think critically about the health of the world\u2019s population and to reflect on overcoming the challenges of achieving good health around the world. Syllabus\nThe course consists of eight topical modules, which will be released in pairs - two modules each Tuesday - during the first four weeks of the course.Module 1: Global Health Governance and Health Systems Module 2: Epidemiological Transition and Global Burden of DiseasesModule 3: Infectious DiseasesModule 4: Environment, Sanitation and Climate ChangeModule 5: Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)Module 6: Mental Health and InjuriesModule 7: Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR)Module 8: Migration, Disasters and Emergency HealthThe fifth (and last) course week is for catching up on assignments and finishing the peer grading process.

The main objective of the course is to enable students to better understand how and why universities are engaged in the globalization process, as well as what the key implications of this development process are. Universities and higher education systems worldwide are being transformed by new and changing actors, practices, programs, policies, and agendas. From notions of 'global competency' and 'international branch campuses,' to ever more common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking that are framed and operate at a global scale, contexts are changing. This massive open online course (MOOC) itself, developed in Madison and Bristol and hosted on the Coursera platform in Silicon Valley, is a perfect case in point!Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the \u2018Knowledge Economy\u2019 is designed to help students better understand some of these complex changes. Our specific objectives are to:Provide an integrated 'big picture' regarding the globalization of higher education and research. &nbsp;Reinforce the value of thinking about processes of change by focusing on emergences -- the forward edges of change -- as well as the frictions associated with these processes. We attempt to make this tangible by highlighting the role of relevant logics, thinkers, institutions, networks, technologies, ideas, temporalities, and regulations.Highlight the role of relative and variable forms of power in shaping agendas and practices, as well as uneven development patterns and outcomes.In the end, we hope to stimulate some exciting globally oriented learning about how the higher education sector - from research to teaching, learning, and service (the 'third mission') - are changing.&nbsp;Syllabus\nWeek 1: Universities (Starting Monday 24 March)Keywords: collaboration, competition, global competency, globalization, internationalization, learning, logics, mechanisms, mission, mobility, models, technologyWeek 2: City-regions (Starting Monday 31 March)Keywords: academic freedom, branch campuses, cities, city-regions, competition, hubs, gateway cities, global cities, innovation systems, liberal arts colleges, mobility, R&amp;D, networks, urbanization.Week 3: Nations (Starting Monday 7 April)Keywords: competition, denationalization, exports, mobility, nation-state, revenue, services, studentsWeek 4: Regions (Starting Monday 14 April)Keywords: collaboration, competition, geopolitics, higher education areas, interregionalism, regionalismWeek 5: Globals (Starting Monday 21 April)Keywords: assessment, benchmarking, competition, desectoralization, framing, governance, hegemony, knowledge, intergovernmental organizations, publishing, R&amp;D, rankings, thinkersWeek 6: World Class (Starting Monday 28 April)Keywords: assessment, benchmarking, bibliometrics, competition, desectoralization, governance, metrics, models, world class universities, world university rankingsWeek 7: Singapore (Starting Monday 5 May)Keywords: academic freedom, branch campuses, city-state, competition, developmental state, global cities, hubs, innovation systems, nation-states, networks, R&amp;D, rankings, regionalism, servicesRecommended Background\nNo formal background knowledge is required; all are welcome. The key thing is to be interested in the contemporary transformation of higher education and research.Suggested Readings\nNo required reading apart from what is provided in\nthe course. We do recommend, though, that you track and follow materials posted on\nfully open access sites such as Inside Higher Ed and University\nWorld News, as well as material shared via the GlobalHigherEd Twitter feed.Course Format\nThe design of this course is different from most Coursera-based courses in that it does not rely on video lectures and associated quizzes. Rather, the content will be rolled out weekly via a 4000-7000 word long text with integrated multimedia elements (audio interviews with experts, visualizations, photographs, select videos, and hyperlinks to documents, reports, articles, etc.). All seven weeks of the course are associated with dedicated discussion forum space where you can participate in (a) independent discussions on the topics of your choice, and (b) instructor-generated discussions on 2-3 designated topics. The course also is intended to function as a free and open-access resource. Therefore, all submitted material during weekly discussion exercises will be automatically associated with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.FAQ\nQ: Will\nI get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nA: Students who successfully complete the course\nrequirements specified in the detailed syllabus are eligible to receive a Statement of\nAccomplishment. You can still participate, though, even if you don\u2019t seek a\nStatement of Accomplishment.Q: What do\nyou mean the course also is intended to function as a free and\nopen-access resource?\nA:\nThe course is intended to function as a free and open-access resource.\nTherefore, all submitted material during weekly exercises will be automatically\nassociated with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license, which gives others considerable\nfreedom to share submitted ideas. Students who submit work to the course\u2019s\nforums retain copyright to it, but irrevocably grant anyone permission to use,\ncopy, modify, and adapt it commercially with\nattribution. As a result, the course should de facto resemble a MOOR (a Massive Open Online Resource) \u2013 a\ntrading space for ideas. The goal of adopting this approach is to enable the\nMOOC/MOOR to facilitate the building of networks between participants, the sharing of resources, and the\nstimulation of new and needed debates about the course topic.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Globalization and You", "cat": "6/economics_finance|9/humanities|14/social_sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 236, "desc": "This course offers an evidence-based analysis of globalization that addresses what is happening to us personally as well as economically amidst the market-led processes of global integration. Particular attention is paid to the ways market-led macro-economic reforms associated with globalization (such as free trade agreements and privatization initiatives) have come together with much more micro innovations in how personal behavior is organized by market forces (rethinking education as a personal investment practice, for example, or outsourcing dating to for-profit companies). \u00a0Mediating between these macro and micro scales of capitalist transformation are a wide array of other market-based mechanisms examined in the course. \u00a0From bond risk ratings to the market metrics shaping FICO scores, personalized medicine and online mapping, these market-mechanisms require close examination. Tracing their influence with an awareness of their material geographic variation and unevenness, the course offers an alternative to economistic assumptions about choice-maximizing behavior on a \u2018level playing field\u2019. It explores instead the complex uneven development dynamics of globalization in ways that allow you to see how your own personal perspectives on these dynamics are at once outcomes and enablers of economic and social change.\u00a0 And, by doing so, the course aims in turn at enabling you to be a more engaged participant in the ongoing debates over the direction these dynamics should take.\u00a0 Key words that are debated, defined and/or explained in the course include: globalization, interdependency, discourse, capitalism, neoliberalism, value, financialization, harmonization, competition, governance, governmentality, power, citizenship, choice, accountability, enclaving, geopolitics, biopolitics, biocapital and global health.Syllabus\nCourse goal: To enable you to comprehend market-led globalization in ways that allow you to evaluate how your own life and personal choices are shaped by market forces and associated global ties. Course-level learning objectives: At the end of this class you will be able to: Describe the main debates and controversies surrounding globalization; Analyze the ties and tensions of uneven global development; Understand the growing impact of global market integration; Synthesize knowledge of market globalization with your own experiences of market forces and market reforms; Evaluate the way in which market forces define and delimit personal choices and everyday life globally; Develop capacity to respond and reflect personally amidst the ties and tensions of market-led globalization. Assignment Overview: Here are some of the course assignments and activities:\u00a0 Video lectures: Most of the course content is delivered through video lectures. Each video runs 10-12 minutes Discussion forums: This class thrives on discussion. Multiple discussion forums are designed to develop out of the lectures. You will have the ability to articulate your own views on globalization as well as learn from your fellow students from around the world. Quizzes: Many video lectures have short quizzes embedded that allow you to check your grasp of basic knowledge as the course proceeds. Peer Assessment Assignments - There are peer assessment activities available for this course. \u00a0By participating in these, and reading and responding to the work of others, you can also help improve your own learning and understanding.\nRecommended Background\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. That said, an interest in common media depictions of globalization will help you understand the main arguments more quickly.\u00a0Relatedly, reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level will enable your more active engagement in course discussion forums and peer assessment exercises.Suggested Readings\nMatthew\nSparke, Introducing Globalization: Ties, Tensions and Uneven Integration\u00a0(Oxford:\nWiley-Blackwell, 2013)\nRandy Martin, \u00a0Financialization\nof daily life\u00a0 (Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 2002)\nArlie Russell Hochschild, A.

You will be equipped with a framework and tools to understand and evaluate the business side of competitive sports around the world. The wide range of global sports businesses constitutes a multi-billion dollar industry. This course will examine and explain the business of sports by analyzing the economic, legal, governance and success models in various sports industries. The primary focus will be on American team sports but comparative global models will be contemplated as well.&nbsp; We will seek to find the answers to questions such as: what lessons can global sports entities learn from each other? What business strategies are used to retain the profitability of world leagues, sports teams and franchises? What lessons can be drawn from the United States based sports models? What revised models should new entrepreneurial leagues apply in order to achieve success? Substantive instruction will be drawn from the likes of the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, MLB, NFL, Premier League, various player unions, China, India, South Africa, Brazil and much more. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, our goal is to equip the student with a framework and tools with which to understand and evaluate the business side of a wide range of competitive sports ventures.Syllabus\nModule One: &nbsp;Sports Leagues and Teams I: Structure and Economics\nWhere is the Money? We will examine the structure of sports leagues and teams including a broad overview of the legal and financial structures. The lecture will also provide an introduction to the revenue generators and revenue distribution models so that students will be able to analyze a variety of sports business enterprises. For example, we will study U.S. and European league governance including promotion and relegation. Specifically, a case study of the NFL and Manchester United sponsorships will be used to engage the students in real time developments in the sports business industry. The important role of revenues from media rights fees will be introduced and more closely examined later as a primary financial driver. Other revenue generating streams such as ticket sales and sponsorships will be highlighted as well.\nModule Two: Sports Leagues and Teams II: Globalization,\nLeadership and Ownership This lecture will focus on the globalization of leagues, leadership and ownership. We will begin by looking at the popularity of leagues and begin a discussion on the largest sports leagues, teams and events. We will analyze the globalization of labor markets and revenue sources with the case of the Big 4 leagues in the U.S. Beyond globalization, we will examine leadership and ownership in the sports business industry. In addition, we will focus on the role of comissioners and analyze reasons for ownership as well as integration strategies that have been developed.\nModule Three: Economic Drivers I: Media rights This week will focus on the revenue sources that flow from the playing of sports events as well as ancillary activities. This includes the traditional radio and television sources as well as the ever growing and emerging new media sources. We will begin by taking a step back to list some of the first ever live televised sporting events including the 1927 Arsenal vs Sheffield game at Highbury and the1939 baseball game between Princeton and Columbia. We will also pay special attention to the rapid growth of media rights fees and include examples such as the NBC Olympics deal. Beyond the revenues that flow from these sources we will also examine how the use of and partnering with these media outlets have evolved from an initial fear of cannibalizing the live gate to current issues about the delivery of&nbsp;\"free\" content and the impact on the ever-changing sports business model.&nbsp;This will include the increasing popularity of Regional Sports Networks.\nModule Four: Economic Drivers II: Stadiums and Arenas\nThe focus here will be on these facilities as both revenue and economic impact generating facilities. Is there a formula used to plan for the development of sports infrastructure? We will focus on stadiums and arenas and delve into the history of the construction of great sports centers and their impact. The case of AEG as a sports facility owner will be examined as well as specific development sagas in Los Angeles and Philadelphia..\nModule Five:&nbsp;Player Salaries,\nUnions and Sports Agents\nThe largest figures on the expense side of the sports business ledger are player salaries. This lecture focuses on salaries as well as the key proponents of those salary increases. Sports agents and unions are key stakeholders in the sports business industry. Agents source and manage talent while unions use collective bargaining to champion for an organization of the economic system that favors salary increases. We will analyze the impact these stakeholders have had on the industry in different regions in the world and use case examples including lockouts from the past. Students will have the opportunity to compare and contrast unions around the world.\nModule Six: The Olympics and The FIFA World Cup\nWe will take a close look at the Olympics history and economic impact. What goes into planning and executing the Olympics? We will analyze the 4-year cycle that businesspersons and athletes take to prepare for the Olympics. We will also examine ideas about the economic impact of these games on the host country\u2019s and the world\u2019s economy. Similarly, the FIFA World Cup, by many measures, is the world\u2019s biggest sports event.&nbsp; We will discuss the role of World Cup plays on the world\u2019s business environment using the following lenses to analyze the tournament: fans, countries, players, media, host country, retailers and of course FIFA.\nModule Seven: Sports Enterprise Global Strategies\nHow do sports entity leaders develop and execute global strategy? We will conclude by contrasting the different penetration levels of various sports and their presence on the global platform. We will use the framework we have developed to hypothesize the globalization of various sports and examine their financial and operational feasibility.&nbsp; We\u2019ll contemplate the elements needed for a truly global, profitable sport entity.&nbsp;\nRecommended Background\nNone; all are welcome.Suggested Readings\nYou do not need to purchase\nanything.

The fate of fossil fuel carbon will\nbe determined by its integration into Earth\u2019s ongoing natural\ncarbon cycle.\nThe class concludes with a look\nat the human impact on Earth\u2019s climate: why we believe it\u2019s\nchanging, why we believe we\u2019re changing it, the impacts that could have, and\nthe options we have to mitigate the situation.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Our First\nClimate ModelWeek 2: On Greenhouse\nGases and the AtmosphereWeek 3: More on the\nAtmosphere \u2013 and FeedbacksWeek 4: The Carbon CycleWeek 5: The Perturbed\nCarbon CycleWeek 6: The Smoking\nGun and PaleoclimateWeek 7: Impacts\nWeek 8: MitigationRecommended Background\nThis course assumes no scientific knowledge and is geared toward a general audience.

Through this course, you'll join the minority that really gets it. Google Inc. is one of the key success stories of the Internet era. The company has expanded beyond its original search business through innovation and acquisition to touch the lives of nearly every person who lives life online. For example, Americans spend more than 3,400 hours per year using consumer media, the field where Google\u2019s impact is most profound, and citizens around the world must understand what the&nbsp;company has wrought&nbsp;not only to control their offline and online environments, but also to interact and engage successfully with anyone in&nbsp;our&nbsp;professional and personal lives.\nEnrollees in this course learn how to understand the tactics that modern media companies, journalists, marketers, politicians, technologists, and social networks are using to reach them and affect their behavior.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part I", "cat": "3/business_management", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 240, "desc": "This course focuses on the common growth challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially. Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.&nbsp;\nThis Course will challenge how you think about growth; give you tools to help you plan for growth, assess the preconditions to grow, and manage the risks of growth. You will study stories of how five different private businesses faced their growth challenges.&nbsp;\nGrowth, if not properly managed, can overwhelm a business, destroying value and in many cases even causing the business to fail. However, the research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others' experience\u2014you do not have to \"reinvent the wheel\".\nThe Course format is case based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Julie Allinson, Susan Fellers, Dave Lindsey, Parik Laxinarayan and Eric Barger. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Weeks and 2 and 5, you will engage in Workshops where you will be asked to use and apply the Course tools and concepts to create growth strategies for two different real-life businesses. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow-students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.&nbsp;\nYou will learn about the: \"3 Myths of Growth\"; the \"Truth About Growth\"; &nbsp;why growth is like \"Mother Nature\"; the \"Gas Pedal\" approach to growth; the all important \"4 Ps\" of how to grow; and how to scale a business strategically.Syllabus\nPlease see&nbsp;Syllabus for further detail on weekly reading and assignments.\nWeek 1: The \"Truth About Growth\":The common beliefs that all growth is good; bigger is always better; and businesses must \"grow or die\" are not true. Growth can be good and growth can be bad. There is no scientific basis for the axiom \"grow or die\". It is a fiction. You will lean from Julie Allinson, the founder of Eyebobs, who has built a successful business selling stylish \u201creading glasses for the irreverent and slightly jaded.\u201d Julie approached growth realistically and understood its value creation and destructive powers. You will learn how she faced manufacturing, sales, and people challenges while building a high growth business\u2014a cool story.\nWeek 2: Workshop\u2014\u201cAre You Ready for Growth?\u201d: &nbsp;Using the Growth Risks Assessment Tool from Week 1, you will meet and advise Susan Fellers, the founder of 3 Fellers Bakery. Susan started a business baking gluten-free products when she was diagnosed with celiac disease. Her start-up was successful, and she needs your help because she has had so many growth alternatives and she does not know which to pursue. You will be asked to create a growth plan for her.&nbsp;\nWeek 3: The 4 Ps of Growth\u2014Planning, Prioritization, Processes and Pace: Using the Defender Direct story, we will learn to better manage the chaos of growth; find a business's strategic focus; how to choose which daily \"fires\" to put out first; how to create replicable processes\u2014\u201cleave a fire extinguisher behind\"; and how to pace growth letting \"up on the growth gas pedal\". Dave Lindsey is our business builder this week, and you will trace his story from starting his business in his home to today being a national, privately owned home installation company generating well in excess of $300M (USD) in revenue with healthy profit numbers.&nbsp;\nWeek 4: The Four Ways To Grow a Business: This week you will learn about the different ways to grow\u2014improvements, innovation, scaling, and strategic acquisitions\u2014with a focus on growth boosters: how to get more customers and sell more products and/or services to existing customers more efficiently. Enchanting Travels, a travel company based in India, is our story this week. You will learn how they built the foundation of their business to scale their focused customer value proposition so they could grow geographically to Africa, South America, and Asia. The story presents a big decision for you: should they franchise their business?\nWeek 5: Workshop\u2014\u201cCreating a Growth Plan\": This week you will read about Eric Barger's challenge: how to take a business that has had little growth selling a commodity product and turn it into a high growth business. You will be asked to create a growth plan for Eric. And after doing that you will learn what Eric did to quadruple his business in three years.&nbsp;\nRecommended Background\nThe only prerequisite for this Course is an interest in learning about how privately-owned entrepreneurial businesses grow. The following people will find this course helpful: students at all levels, private business owners, managers of private businesses, employees of private businesses, and people interested in growth, economic development, and job creation.Suggested Readings\nAll of the required Course readings are listed in the Syllabus and will be provided for free by the University of Virginia Darden School Foundation.\nAdditional reading that you might find helpful for the Course include: 1.

The videos discuss the articles and case studies to be read prior to the class. There are in-video quizzes embedded within the segments to evaluate your understanding of the concepts. You may proceed at your own pace.&nbsp;\nThere are also Workshop exercises, in which you have the opportunity to use the concepts discussed in the readings and videos to determine a course of action for a real, private business growth challenge. After completing the exercises, you will learn what action the business actually took and whether it was successful.&nbsp;\nThere is a (non-optional) final exam of multiple choice questions.&nbsp;\nDiscussion Forums\nYou may choose to create course communities through the Discussion Forums, which will allow you to learn from your classmates. Communities can be formed based on your country of residence or based on the type of business you own or want to learn about. The purpose of the community is to provide a forum for you to learn from each other. It\u2019s an opportunity for you create and grow together.&nbsp;\nInstructor Engagement\nI will be on the Course Discussion Forums from time to time to answer questions, chat and respond to other conversations. I will also host&nbsp;Google Hangouts (web conferences)&nbsp;with up to&nbsp;6 students at a time. The Hangouts will be recorded, and all students&nbsp;will be able to view the conferences live or later through YouTube.&nbsp;\nFAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.How will I learn in this Course?\nThis Course is based on the principle that one learns by doing. There are required and optional readings. You will be asked to apply concepts discussed in the videos and readings in Workshop exercises, and if you choose to join a Course Community, you will learn from each other.\nWhat resources will I need for this Course?\nNone. The Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia is providing this Course for free because of its mission to positively impact society. Darden Business Publishing will provide all required Course reading for free.\nWhy is this Course important?\nGrowing private businesses is in many parts of the world a major job creator and a key route to building a better life for oneself and one's family. In effect, this Course is about the pursuit of hopes and dreams. I think doing business is much more than just about making money. Doing business is the primary way many people achieve their hopes and dreams to provide a better life for themselves and their families. And in doing so, building a business can also create value for employees, customers, and society.\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this Course?\nBy bringing real-life business growth stories and challenges to you, this Course will teach you a different way to think about business growth and an appreciation for how managing risks and constant learning and improvement are critical to business success. You will also acquire tools, such as the 4 Ps in Week 2, that can help you manage your life.\n"}

PART 1 OF THE GROW TO GREATNESS COURSE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR TAKING THIS COURSE. Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.\n&nbsp;\nThis Course will focus on the common \u201cpeople\u201d challenges private growth companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different private businesses faced their growth challenges.\n&nbsp;\nWhile strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build a great growth company, they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right kind of leadership, culture, and people. My research clearly showed that many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building the right management team that can play well together. The research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others' experience\u2014you do not have to \"reinvent the wheel\".\n&nbsp;\nThe Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford, John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.\n&nbsp;\nYou will learn how entrepreneurs must grow, too; the \u201csecret\u201d of high performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement; how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management team.Syllabus\nPlease see Syllabus for further detail on weekly reading and assignments.\n&nbsp;\nWeek 1: The Entrepreneur Must Grow, Too! In order for a business to grow, the entrepreneur must grow. First, the entrepreneur\u2019s role will evolve from primarily being a \u201cdoer\u201d to a manager then to a leader and ultimately to being a coach/mentor. Additionally the entrepreneur in most cases moves from being a specialist to a generalist to ultimately being a \u201cconductor\u201d. We will learn from Barbara Lynch, a much-heralded Chef who, with little formal education or training, built a multi-concept restaurant \u201cempire\u201d in Boston, and from Ryan Dienst, one of the founders of Global Medical Imaging.\n&nbsp;\nWeek 2: The \u201cSecret\u201d of High Performance is High Employee Engagement. Using the Leaders Bank and Trilogy Health Services stories we will look at how two businesses put in place people policies, practices, and a leadership model that led to high employee engagement, loyalty, and productivity that drove high customer satisfaction. We will also focus on the principles of people-centric leadership. During this Week, you will engage with Community members in Workshop learning.\n&nbsp;\nWeek 3: Growth Is Much More Than a Strategy\u2014It Requires a SYSTEM. Growth is behavioral. To enable and promote the desired behaviors, entrepreneurs have to create an internal aligned system that links, in a consistent self-reinforcing manner, strategy/business model, culture, structure, leadership behaviors, measurements, and rewards. This week we will learn from John Gabbert, who built highly successful retail home furnishings chain Room &amp; Board his way, rejecting the common business practices of his industry. My MBA students find this story mindboggling. If you have work experience, you will also use the Growth System Assessment Tool.\n&nbsp;\nWeek 4: The Surprising Difficulties in Building a Senior Management Team. &nbsp;I was surprised in my research at how difficult it was for entrepreneur\u2019s to build a senior management team. In many cases it took multiple hirings to get the right fit. And even then, getting the senior management team to \u201cplay well together\u201d was challenging. Lastly, most entrepreneurs were not prepared for the need to \u201cupgrade\u201d their management team as the business grew. This week we will study how Mike Cote took over as CEO of SecureWorks, a floundering Internet security company, and grew it into an industry leader ultimately selling the company last year to Dell for hundreds of millions of dollars.\nRecommended Background\nYou may attend this Course even if you did not take Grow to Greatness,\nPart 1.

The American health care system has many problems. 50 million people are uninsured. Quality is extremely uneven, with peaks of greatness at leading academic centers but overall poor quality in both process measures and outcomes such as asthma deaths. Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.\nThis course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs. Throughout lessons regarding health economics, health policy, and medical practice will be elucidated.\nThis class is open to anyone that is interested in gaining a better understanding of the US health care system and the challenges of health care reform. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge of the health system.Syllabus\nWeek 1 \u2013 Growth in US Health CareMuch of the impetus for health care reform is provided by\nthe need to \u201cbend the cost curve.\u201d \u00a0Over\nthe past few decades, health care cost growth has consistently outpaced overall\neconomic growth, taking up an increasing share of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nand government budgets. \u00a0We will discuss\nthe factors that drive cost growth. Live Q & A with\nDr. EmanuelDr. Emanuel will host a live online Q & A session on\ntopics related to health care and current events. Week 2 \u2013 Structure of the US Health CareHow do Americans get their health care? Who pays\nfor it? How did the system we have today come to be? \u00a0These are some of the questions we will answer\nthis week when we look at the structure of the US health care system\nWeek 3 \u2013 Access to and Quality of Health Care in the USMost Americans receive insurance through their employer or\nthe government (e.g. Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP).\u00a0\nBefore the ACA, approximately 50 million Americans did not have health\ninsurance. This week we explore access to health care insurance, the profile of\nthe average uninsured person, disparities in quality and outcomes, and the link\nbetween insurance and access to health care.\nWeek 4 \u2013 Health Care MalpracticeIn some physician specialties, as many as one in four\npractitioners a year have a medical malpractice claim filed against them,\nmaking this a matter of frequent public and policy debate. We will discuss medical\nerrors, the workings of the malpractice system, liability insurance, and the\ncontribution of negligence and malpractice costs to the health system\u2019s overall\nbottom line.\u00a0 Week 5 \u2013 History of health care reform; The ACA: An Overview Health care reform in America has been 100 years in the\nmaking, starting with Theodore Roosevelt and continuing through the Clinton\nadministration. We discuss past attempts at health care reform and why they met\nwith resistance. We then move on to an overview of the 2010 Affordable Care\nAct.\nWeek 6 - The ACA: Access to Health CareThe overview of the ACA continues with a discussion of the provisions\ndesigned to expand access to health care.\u00a0\nWe will cover employer-sponsored health insurance provisions. This session will feature a guest\nlecture by J. Sanford Schwartz, M.D.\nWeek 7 \u2013 The ACA: Cost ControlThis week we will discuss projections of health care cost\ngrowth under the ACA, followed by mechanisms through which the ACA aims to\ntackle health care cost growth. Week 8 \u2013 The ACA: Health Care Delivery and QualityThe final topic of\nthe course is the ACA\u2019s impact on the quality and delivery of care. The ACA includes\nprovisions for institutional innovations, i.e. changes in how the system\ndelivers care. \u00a0It also contains rules\nand incentives for providers to cut down on mistakes and deliver proven,\nvaluable care.

Each week, students will watch approximately 30 - 40 minutes of lectures delivered by Dr. Emanuel. Students should expect to spend 2 - 5 hours per week reading related materials from the reading list, all of which are freely accessible online. Students taking the course for a grade will complete one short essay question (approximately 1 page) per week, which will be peer-graded based on a detailed answer key provided after the due date. Of the eight scores earned for assignments, the lowest two scores will be dropped in calculating the final grade. The remaining six scores will be weighted equally. As a result, students who miss a homework assignment can still earn full credit in the course. There are no exams or final projects in this course. Students not taking the course for a grade may choose not to complete the assignments. The details of these logistics are subject to change; if changes are made, students will be notified via an announcement and this page will be updated.FAQ\nCourseWill this content be available after the course is over? Yes, we intend to maintain this information online.Will I receive college credit for this course?Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania do not provide\ncollege credit for this course, however, students who satisfactorily complete\nthe course requirements will receive a certificate of completion.How many students are in this class?This information reaches a large number of people.&nbsp; In the summer of 2012, 17,246 people were\nsigned up to take the course on the first week of lectures and 31,967 people\nwere registered by end of the course.&nbsp;\nHowever, of those students, 3,428 submitted the first assignment and\n1,066 submitted the final assignment.&nbsp;\n1,340 people completed at least five assignments and 1,023 people passed\nthe course.&nbsp; While there is more attrition\nthan in a traditional classroom, this is in part due to the online, free aspect\nof the course as people may sign up who are curious, but are not interested in\ncompleting the course.&nbsp; This\ncourse offers significant flexibility for students in terms of not only when\nyou do the work, but also how much you complete.&nbsp; Some students wish to learn as much as\npossible about the topic while others are interested in learning only a portion\nof the material.&nbsp; Students complete the\nwork because they are genuinely interested in learning the material.\nI joined the class late.&nbsp; Can I\nstill participate?\nThe top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for\nyour grade.&nbsp; Thus you may miss 2\nassignments without impacting your grade.&nbsp;\nEven if you joined too late to pass the course, you may participate in\nthe class at any point by watching the videos, reading the material, and\nparticipating in the forums. Readings:Why did you select these\nreadings?The readings are limited to those\nwhich are freely available to the public, to facilitate anyone participating in\nthe course.&nbsp; Students widely range in their background and health care\nexperience.&nbsp; Thus, while the selected readings are generally at college\nlevel, they assume a student will have only a basic understanding of the\nAmerican health care system.&nbsp; Additional optional readings are provided\nfor those who wish to delve deeper into a particular topic.Why do you have optional\nreadings?Some people may be interesting in\nlearning more about a topic.&nbsp; For those students, we have identified\noptional readings.&nbsp; These optional readings provide background material or\nmore in-depth information on a topic.&nbsp; You will&nbsp;be graded only on\ninformation in the required readings. Assignments:I can\u2019t complete an assignment.&nbsp;\nWill I fail?The top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for your\ngrade.&nbsp; Thus you may miss 2 assignments\nwithout impacting your grade.&nbsp;How will I be graded?You are given one assignment each week.&nbsp; The top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for\nyour grade.&nbsp; Thus you may miss 2\nassignments without impacting your grade.&nbsp;\nFor each assignment, you will be graded by a minimum of four other\npeople.&nbsp; The high and low score for each\nassignment will be tossed out and the other scores averaged.Am I required to participate in the forums?&nbsp; Are the quizzes graded?Participation in the forums and quizzes available through\nthe video content are not graded.How will I grade others?Reviewers will receive a grading rubric and sample answer.How will you ensure that the grades are fair?We expect students are motivated to participate in their\neducation and we ask that everyone grade each other in an objective, fair, and\nunbiased manner.&nbsp; Grading will be\ndouble-blind; graders will not know whose work they are grading, and students\nwill not know who graded their work.&nbsp;\nEach assignment is graded by several different people, which will reduce\nany potential bias, with the high and low scores dropped for each student.&nbsp; Furthermore, the selection of assignments to\ngrade for each person will be random each week, so any given student is\nunlikely to have his/her work graded by any given student grader more than once.&nbsp; Finally, we will be checking the grading for\nconsistency (e.g. by comparing against grades assigned by the instructor to a\nfew \"sample\" assignments).Why do you require students to grade each other?This course is freely available on the internet.&nbsp; During the summer 2012 course, 31, 967\nstudents signed up for the course.&nbsp;\nCoursera and the University of Pennsylvania are not able to support\nproviding this course free for everyone without utilizing innovative and\nnon-traditional grading mechanisms.&nbsp; We\nalso believe that in grading each other, you will learn the material\nbetter.What happens if I grade more assignments one week than the minimum\nrequired?&nbsp; Will I get extra credit?You will receive the appreciation of your classmates and\nhopefully a greater understanding of the material.&nbsp; You will not, however, receive any extra\ncredit.Can I grade extra assignments one week to make up for grading fewer\nassignments another week?No.&nbsp; You are required to grade a minimum\nof five assignments each week.\nTechnical\nPlease\nprovide a spell-check option.Until Coursera is able to provide this option, we suggest that you draft\nyour answer in Word, spell-check it, and then copy and paste your answer into\nthe answer box.How\ndo I copy my answer into the assignment submission box?&nbsp; It does not work.This is possibly a browser issue; Coursera is optimized for Google\nChrome.&nbsp; Try using the command keys to\ncopy and paste your answer from Word: Ctrl-A (highlight all), Ctrl-C (copy),\nand Ctrl-V (paste).How\ndo you close the window for the multiple-choice question to resume the lecture\nvideo after the quizzes pop up?This is possibly a browser issue.&nbsp; Coursera supports modern web standards and\nthe many devices that run browsers that support these features.&nbsp; Chrome, Firefox, IE (9-10), and Safari meet\nthese requirements.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For more information on Penn\u2019s Open Learning initiative, please go to:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://openlearning.upenn.edu/\n"}
{"lang": "en", "name": "Heterogeneous Parallel Programming", "cat": "5/computer_science|8/engineering_technology", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 250, "desc": "This course introduces concepts, languages, techniques, and patterns for programming heterogeneous, massively parallel processors. Its contents and structure have been significantly revised based on the experience gained from its initial offering in 2012. It covers heterogeneous computing architectures, data-parallel programming models, techniques for memory bandwidth management, and parallel algorithm patterns. All computing\nsystems, from mobile to supercomputers, are becoming heterogeneous, massively\nparallel&nbsp;computers for higher power efficiency and&nbsp;computation\nthroughput. While the computing community is racing to build tools and\nlibraries to&nbsp;ease the use of these systems, effective and confident\nuse&nbsp;of these systems will always require knowledge about low-level\nprogramming&nbsp;in these systems. This course is designed for students to\nlearn the essence&nbsp;of low-level programming interfaces and how to use these\ninterfaces to achieve application goals. CUDA C, with its good balance between\nuser control and verboseness, will serve as the teaching vehicle for the first\nhalf of the course. Students will then extend their learning into closely\nrelated programming interfaces such as OpenCL, OpenACC, and C++AMP.\nThe course is unique in that it is application oriented and only introduces the\nnecessary&nbsp;underlying computer science and computer engineering knowledge for\nunderstanding.&nbsp;It covers the concept of data parallel execution models,\nmemory models for managing locality, tiling techniques for reducing bandwidth\nconsumption, parallel algorithm patterns,&nbsp;overlapping computation with\ncommunication, and a variety of\nheterogeneous parallel programming interfaces. The concepts learned in this\ncourse form a strong foundation for learning other types of parallel\nprogramming systems.\nSyllabus\nWeek One: Introduction to Heterogeneous\nComputing, Overview of CUDA C, and Kernel-Based Parallel Programming, with lab tour\nand programming assignment of vector addition in CUDA C.&nbsp;Week Two: Memory Model for Locality, Tiling\nfor Conserving Memory Bandwidth, Handling Boundary Conditions, and Performance\nConsiderations, with&nbsp;programming assignment of simple matrix-matrix multiplication\nin CUDA C.Week Three: Parallel Convolution Pattern, with\nprogramming assignment of tiled matrix-matrix multiplication in CUDA C.Week Four: Parallel Scan Pattern, with\nprogramming&nbsp;assignment of parallel convolution in CUDA C.Week Five: Parallel Histogram Pattern and\nAtomic Operations, with programming assignment of parallel scan in CUDA C.Week Six: Data Transfer and Task\nParallelism, with programming assignment of parallel histogram in CUDA C.Week Seven: Introduction to OpenCL,\nIntroduction to C++AMP, Introduction to OpenACC, with programming assignment of\nvector addition using streams in CUDA C.Week Eight: Course Summary,\nOther Related Programming Models \u2013Thrust,&nbsp;Bolt, and CUDA FORTRAN, with\nprogramming assignment of simple matrix-matrix multiplication in choice of\nOpenCL, C++AMP, or OpenACC.Week Nine: complete any\nremaining lab assignments, with optional, bonus programming assignments in choice\nof OpenCL, C++AMP, or OpenACC.\nRecommended Background\nProgramming experience in C/C++.Suggested Readings\nAlthough the class is designed to be self-contained, students\nwanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in a one-quarter\nclass can find a much more extensive coverage of this topic in the book Programming\nMassively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach (Applications of GPU\nComputing Series) -&nbsp; 2nd Edition, by David Kirk\nand Wen-mei Hwu, published by Morgan Kaufmann (Elsevier), ISBN 0123814723.\nCourse Format\nThe class will\nconsist of weekly lecture videos, which are between 15 and 20 minutes in\nlength. There will also be weekly quizzes and programming assignments.\nFAQ What resources will I need for this class? A laptop or desktop computer. GPU enabled hardware can be helpful but will not be required. Why not teach the whole course using OpenCL? While OpenCL is an industry standard and widely supported by many CPU and GPU vendors, it is much more complex and tedious to use than CUDA. The complexity and tedious details distract from the concepts and techniques that one should master. From our experience, it is much more productive to use CUDA to teach the concepts and techniques. We will then teach the additional complexities of OpenCL so that students can comfortably apply all the concepts to OpenCL. How did the students do in the previous offering of the HPP Course? Out of the 9,908 students who did quizzes and programming assignments,.2,811 received Certificate of Achievement or Certificate of Distinction. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? You will learn how to unleash the massive computing power from mobile processors to supercomputers for your applications. "}

Read classics of the genre, encounter bestselling writers of historical fiction, and discover your own historical archive while interacting with a global community of interested readers. Plagues,\nWitches, and War\nwill provide an engaging introduction to the genre and craft of historical\nfiction. You will learn\nabout some of the classics in the genre while encountering five established and\nemerging authors of historical fiction (including a Pulitzer Prize winner and\nseveral New York Times bestsellers) who\nwill be visiting our class as guest writers.\nIn Parts 1 and 3, I'll introduce the genre to you, and we'll read together from\na number of classic historical novels from England and the US: Scott\u2019s Waverley (often described as the first historical novel), Charles\nDickens\u2019s A Tale of Two Cities (set\nin Paris and London during the French Revolution), William Wells Brown\u2019s Clotel (the first novel in the African\nAmerican literary tradition, set in part around the time of Thomas Jefferson), and\nseveral others. Given the length and complexity of these novels, lectures will\ncover selected excerpts only while providing\nan overview of the development of historical fiction during the nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries. We'll then move into the twentieth century, with lectures on modernism, metafiction, the mass market, and the New Historical Novel of Latin America. You should think of these parts of the course as\nproviding a kind of toolkit for your future reading in the genre. What\nmotivates certain writers to turn to particular historical moments, and what do\nthey hope to find there? What creative challenges do historical settings and\npersonages present to authors seeking to reimagine the past in fictional\nnarrative?\nGuided by similar\nquestions, Parts 2 and 4-7 of the course will consist of a series of seminars on\nthe craft of historical fiction. These seminars will feature five novelists who\nwill be our guests for recorded workshop and discussion sessions as well as on-line forums\nand chats with Coursera students. We are lucky to have an extraordinary line-up\nof guest artists whose novels bring to life an array of past cultures, from\nancient Rome to Renaissance England to nineteenth-century Malaysia. We will\nread selections from these authors\u2019 novels along with some of the original\nhistorical sources that inspired their fiction. During these sessions our\nguests will discuss the process of research, the crafting of character,\nsetting, and dialogue, and the challenges of historical fiction as a genre,\namong other topics. (See below for the list of guest\nwriters.)\u00a0\nAlong with these\nintroductions to the genre and craft of historical fiction, you will have a\nchance to research and, if you wish, begin crafting your own historical\nfiction. All students will be assigned to identify either a local archive in their\nimmediate geographical area or a virtual archive on line. This archival\ncomponent of the course, which you\u2019ll be encouraged to share in the forums, on the\ncourse Facebook page, and over our Twitter stream, will expose you to a wealth\nof historical materials inspiring your peers around the world. For those\nwishing to attempt writing historical fiction themselves, an optional, ungraded assignment will allow you to post a brief piece of creative\nwork to be read and commented upon by your fellow students.\u00a0\nHistorical fiction immerses\nus in the past in new and unexpected ways, even while teaching us much about\nthe present. I hope you\u2019ll join me as we explore this immensely rewarding genre\nand learn from some of its most talented contemporary practitioners. \u00a0***Here are our visiting writers, with links to their books and home pages:Jane Alison, Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Virginia, is the author of three novels (including The Marriage of the Sea,\u00a0a New York Times Notable Book for 2003) as well as a memoir,\u00a0The Sisters Antipodes. We will be reading from her first novel,\u00a0The Love Artist, featuring the poet Ovid and his mysterious exile from Rome to the shores of the Black Sea.Geraldine Brooks, an internationally bestselling novelist whose works have been translated into dozens of languages, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2006 for her novel\u00a0March.

This course, part 1 of a 2-course sequence, examines the&nbsp;history of rock, primarily&nbsp;as it unfolded in the United States,&nbsp;from the days before rock (pre-1955) to the end of the 1960s. This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector,&nbsp;Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previously&nbsp;had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion.

We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the&nbsp;hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s.

{"lang": "en", "name": "A Brief History of Humankind", "cat": "9/humanities", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 258, "desc": "The course surveys the entire length of human history, from the evolution of various human species in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the twenty-first century. About 2 million years ago our human\nancestors were&nbsp;insignificant animals living in a corner of Africa. Their impact on the world was no greater than\nthat of gorillas, zebras, or chickens. Today humans are spread all over the\nworld, and they are the most important animal around. The very future of life\non Earth depends on the ideas and behavior of our species. This course will explain how we humans have conquered planet Earth, and how\nwe have changed our environment, our societies, and our own bodies and minds.\nThe aim of the course is to give students a brief but complete overview of\nhistory, from the Stone Age to the age of capitalism\nand genetic engineering. The course invites us\nto question the basic narratives of our world. Its conclusions are enlightening\nand at times provocative. For example:\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWe\nrule the world because we are the only animal that can believe in things that\nexist purely in our own imagination, such as gods, states, money and human\nrights.&nbsp; \u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nHumans are ecological serial killers \u2013 even with stone-age tools, our ancestors wiped\nout half the planet's large terrestrial mammals well before the advent of\nagriculture. \u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe\nAgricultural Revolution was history\u2019s biggest fraud \u2013 wheat domesticated\nSapiens rather than the other way\naround. \u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMoney\nis the most universal and pluralistic system of mutual trust ever devised.\nMoney is the only thing everyone trusts.\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nEmpire\nis the most successful political system humans have invented, and our present\nera of anti-imperial sentiment is probably a short-lived aberration. \u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nCapitalism\nis a religion rather than just an economic theory \u2013 and it is the most\nsuccessful religion to date.\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe\ntreatment of animals in modern agriculture may turn out to be the worst crime\nin &nbsp; &nbsp; history.\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWe\nare far more powerful than our ancestors, but we aren\u2019t much happier.\n\u00b7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Humans will soon disappear. With the help of novel technologies, within a few\ncenturies or even decades, Humans will upgrade themselves into completely\ndifferent beings, enjoying godlike qualities and abilities. History began when\nhumans invented gods \u2013 and will end when humans become gods.&nbsp;Syllabus\nPart I: The Cognitive Revolution &nbsp;\nLecture 1: The Human Family\nOne hundred thousand years ago, at\nleast six different species of humans inhabited planet Earth. Our species, Homo\nsapiens, was just one among them. Who were the others? Where did they come\nfrom? And what happened to them? Why is there today only one species of humans\u2014Homo\nsapiens?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 2: The Cognitive\nRevolution\nThe Cognitive Revolution, about\n70,000 years ago, enabled Homo sapiens to conquer the world and drive\nall other human species to extinction. During this revolution, Homo sapiens\ndeveloped a new and remarkable kind of language. How was this language\ndifferent from the languages of earlier human species and of other animals? What\nwere the advantages that Homo sapiens gained from this unique language? &nbsp;\nLecture 3: Daily Life in the\nStone Age\nWhat was life like for people who\nlived 30,000 years ago? What did they do when they woke up in the morning? How\ndid they organize their societies? Did they have monogamous relationships and\nnuclear families? Did they have religions, revolutions, and wars?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 4: The Human Flood\nFollowing the Cognitive Revolution,\nHomo sapiens spread all over the planet. While doing this, it drove\nnumerous other species to extinction. In Australia, up to 95% of all large\nanimal species vanished. In America,\n84 of 107 large mammal species disappeared. Altogether, about half of the large\nterrestrial mammals that populated Earth became extinct. How could a few\nmillion individuals who possessed no more than Stone Age technology have caused\nsuch devastation?\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPart II: The Agricultural Revolution &nbsp;\nLecture 5: History\u2019s Biggest\nFraud\nAbout 12,000 years ago, people in\nthe Middle East, China, and Central America began domesticating plants and animals.\nIn the process, Homo sapiens,\ntoo, was domesticated, abandoning a life of hunting and gathering\nfor the pleasures and discomforts of agriculture. For most people, the\ndiscomforts outweighed the pleasures. The Agricultural Revolution made the life\nof the average person harder. Why, then, did it occur?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 6: Building Pyramids\nFor millions of years, humans lived\nin intimate bands of no more than a few dozen individuals. Our biological\ninstincts are adapted to this way of life. Humans are consequently ill-equipped\nto cooperate with large numbers of strangers. Yet shortly after the Agricultural\nRevolution erupted, humans established cities, kingdoms, and huge empires. How\ndid they do it? How can millions of strangers agree on shared laws, norms and\nvalues?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 7: There is No Justice\nin History A critical factor in the formation\nof complex societies was the division of the population into a hierarchy of\ngroups. Agricultural and industrial societies have been built on hierarchies of\nclass, race, ethnicity, and gender. Why was it impossible to create a just and\nequal society? What is the deep root of prejudice and injustice? In particular,\nwhy did almost all known societies treat men as superior to women? &nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPart III: The Unification of Humankind\n&nbsp;\nLecture 8: The Direction of History\nAfter the Agricultural Revolution,\nhumans created many different cultures and societies. The relations between\nthese different societies were very complex, and involved wars and conflicts as\nwell as trade, immigration and imitation. But as time went by, the connections\nbetween the societies became stronger and stronger, so that humankind was\ngradually united into a single global society. Three main forces shaped this\nprocess of unification. The first was money and trade. Money is the most\nuniversal system of mutual trust ever devised by humans. How come even people\nwho believe in different gods and obey rival kings, are nevertheless willing to\nuse the same money?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 9: Imperial Visions\nThe second force that shaped the\nprocess of human unification is imperialism. The idea of empire is seen today\nin a very negative light, but empires have played such a central role in human\nhistory that it\u2019s hard to regard them as totally evil. What exactly is an\nempire? How have empires succeeded in uniting under their control different\necological regions, ethnic groups, and religious communities? How can we\nbalance the positive contribution of empires with their record of violence and\noppression? And what is the future of the imperial ideal? Is the world destined\nto be ruled by a new global empire?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 10: The Law of Religion\nThe third force that shaped the\nprocess of human unification is religion. The role of religion in history is\nextremely controversial. Some see religion as the root of all evil, while for\nothers it is the primary source of happiness, empathy, and progress. Can we\narrive at a balanced judgment? What were the main landmarks in the religious\nhistory of the world? In what ways did different cultures understand the\nuniverse, distinguish good from evil, and explain the ubiquitous presence of\nsuffering?\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPart IV. The Scientific Revolution\n&nbsp;\nLecture 11: The Discovery of\nIgnorance\nDuring the last 500 years the\nprocess of human unification was completed. At the same time, there has been an\nexplosive growth in the power of humankind, due above all to the discoveries of\nmodern science. Humankind has become increasingly convinced that the only thing\nthat limits its power is its own ignorance, and that the discovery of new\nknowledge can enable it to do almost anything. How is the modern scientific\ntradition different from all previous traditions of knowledge? What accounts\nfor its sudden rise and for its unparalleled achievements? &nbsp;\nLecture 12: The Marriage of\nScience and Empire\nModern science developed in\nalliance with the modern European empires. The conquest of new knowledge\ndepended upon and made possible the conquest of new territories. What exactly\nwas the contribution of science to the rise of the European empires, and what\nwas the contribution of the European empires to the development of science? And\nwhy did it all start in Europe, rather than in China,\nIndia, or the Middle East? &nbsp;\nLecture 13: The Capitalist Creed\nThe close ties between science and\nimperialism were in fact just one part of a more complex relationship. The\nthird crucial member of this relationship was capitalism, which financed both\nscience and empire, and which led to an unprecedented growth in the world\neconomy. How does a capitalist economy function? How is it different from traditional\neconomies? Is capitalism natural, or is it really a kind of religion?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 14: The Industrial\nRevolution\nDuring the last 200 years, the\ncombination of science, imperialism and capitalism produced the Industrial\nRevolution. This revolution gave humankind control of enormous new energy\nresources, and enabled humankind to start manufacturing far more things than\never before, far more quickly, and far more cheaply. How did this change the\nglobal ecology, daily life, and human psychology?\n&nbsp;\nLecture 15: A Permanent\nRevolution\nThe Industrial Revolution opened an\nera of permanent revolution. The late modern socio-political order is constantly\nchanging, never settling into any stable pattern. The pillars of human\norder\u2014most notably, the family and the intimate community\u2014are crumbling around\nus. How do humans deal with the resulting vacuum and chaos? How do society and\npolitics function without stability? Is the world becoming more violent and\ndangerous, or is it actually more peaceful and secure than ever before? &nbsp;\nLecture 16: And They Lived\nHappily Ever After Have 500 years of amazing discoveries,\ndevelopments, and revolutions made people happier? Are people today happier\nthan in the Middle Ages, or in the Stone Age? If not, what was the point of all\nthese changes? Most history books ignore these issues, yet these are the most\nimportant questions we can ask about history. New studies in biology,\neconomics, and psychology are offering fascinating insights into the history of\nhuman happiness.\n&nbsp;\nLecture 17: The End of Homo Sapiens\nOver the last few decades humans\nhave began to bend and break the laws of natural selection\u2014laws that have\ngoverned life on Earth for the past four billion years. New technologies such\nas genetic engineering and nanotechnology are giving us unprecedented abilities\nto design not only the world around us, but also our own bodies, our\npersonalities, and our desires. How will this influence society and culture?\nDoes anybody know where we are heading? What is the likely future of humankind?\nRecommended Background\nThere are no entry requirements.\nThe course is intended both to people who have never studied history seriously,\nand wish to gain an overview of the human past, and to people who have studied\nhistory before, but who would like to get a fresh and challenging perspective\non it.&nbsp;Suggested Readings\nParticipating in the course does\nnot require any reading, but students who wish to deepen their understanding of the subject may refer to the following book:Yuval Noah Harari,&nbsp;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (London: Harvill Secker, 2014).This book is available not only in English, but in close to 30 other languages, including&nbsp;Chinese (China edition),&nbsp;Chinese (Taiwan edition)&nbsp;&nbsp;German, Spanish,&nbsp;Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Polish,&nbsp;Czech, Catalan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Slovenian.&nbsp;Course Format\nThe course includes 17 lectures.\nEach is 60-120 minutes long, divided into 3-6 short segments.Students can watch each lecture in one go, or break it up into several segments."}

What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends\u2019 faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms. The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.Syllabus\nWeek 1- Introduction to Image and Video Processing: We will cover the fundamentals, including some elements of visual perception, sensing, sampling, and quantization. Week 2- Image and Video Compression: We will learn the fundamental tools enabling us to receive images from Mars, to upload images to the web, and to store a lot of images and videos in our mobile phones. Week 3- Spatial Processing: This week we will learn some of the most classical and fundamental tools that help us still today to make noisy, blurry, and dark images look much better. Week 4- Image Restoration: When something is known or estimated about the degradation process, we can do much better, and in this week we will learn how. Week 5- Image Segmentation: How do we split an image or video in its core components? Week 6- Geometric PDEs: We will learn about the use of partial differential equations and geometric deformations for problems like image enhancement and object detection. Week 7- Image and Video Inpainting: How to make objects disappear and other special effects. Week 8- Sparse Modeling and Compressed Sensing: We will cover some of the most modern tools for image enhancement and image analysis. Week 9- Medical Imaging: As an example of medical image analysis, we will illustrate examples and techniques in the areas of brain research and virus analysis.Computer Exercises- See below for more details on this.Recommended Background\nImage and video analysis can be approached from numerous areas of mathematics, from linear algebra to geometry, optimization, and differential equations. We plan to make all the lectures as self-contained as possible, but basic background in linear algebra and digital signal processing will be helpful.Suggested Readings\nThe first 5 lectures will follow, in part, \"Digital Image Processing, 3rd edition\" by&nbsp;Gonzalez and Woods.&nbsp;The more advanced material will be based on material the instructor will make available. Some interesting books for the advanced material include: Michael Elad, Sparse and Redundant Representations: From Theory to Applications in Signal and Image Processing, Springer. Guillermo Sapiro, Geometric Partial Differential Equations in Image Analysis, Cambridge University Press. Alex Bronstein, Michael Bronstein, and Ron Kimmel, Numerical Geometry of Non-Rigid Shapes, Springer One of the first and still outstanding books in digital image processing is: Azriel Rosenfeld and Avinash Kak, Digital Picture Processing, Academic Press.Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, normally less then 15 minutes in length. Several such segments will constitute a weekly class. Weekly homework/quizzes will help students to stay on track. There will also be frequently assigned optional programming projects to help students experience the practice of image and video analysis. Weekly subjects will stay as self-contained as possible, starting every week with a new topic in the rich area of image and video analysis.\nComputer Exercises\nWe will have numerous optional computer exercises, with forums and teaching assistants dedicated to them. This in addition to students, which in the past have produced outstanding codes and helped each other tremendously.\nMathWorks (http://www.mathworks.com/) will provide free Matlab (with the necessary toolboxes) for those students registered to the class and that are interested in using Matlab for their optional homework. Tutorials will be provided to help those that need to learn the language.FAQ\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nThe main resource needed for this class is curiosity and an appetite for learning a new topic. For those interested in pursuing some of the projects, having Matlab (with their own license) and the image processing toolbox will be very useful. However, the same projects could be performed in other programming environments available to the students.\nWhat are the coolest things I'll learn if I take this class? How to make objects disappear in images and videos, how to see the shape of viruses, how to analyze the inside of your brain, and how we can store so many images and videos in our mobile phones.\n"}

Laws governing who may enter the country, the conditions of entry, and actions that may result in deportation will occupy the remainder of the course. This week we examine the history of U.S. immigration. Beginning with the Chinese Exclusion Acts in the 1880's, U.S. law has at times discriminated against specific racial and ethnic groups. Ironically, the most important constitutional law doctrines governing U.S. immigration law solidified during those eras. The modern constitutional doctrine of \"plenary power\" is introduced here.Myths and Realities of an \"Open Border\" PastThe Chinese Exclusion Acts and the U.S. Supreme CourtThe \"Plenary Power\" Doctrine in U.S. Constitutional LawModern Structure: Federal Agencies and CourtsThe Faces of Immigration Today: NumbersWeek 3: Eligibility for Immigration, Part IThis week we will consider the requirements for legal immigration to the U.S. These come in the form of general criteria applicable to all who seek to enter (e.g., no criminal history, not likely to become a \"public charge\"), as well as specific requirements for an entry visa and the \"green card\" -- permission to remain in the United States indefinitely as a lawful permanent resident.Requirements for Entry:\u00a0 Introduction to the Grounds of InadmissibilityInadmissibility Based on Immigration ControlInadmissibility Based on National SecurityInadmissibility Based on Criminal ActsInadmissibility Based on Public HealthInadmissibility on Economic GroundsProcedures to Determine AdmissibilityWeek 4: Eligibility for Immigration, Part IIWeek four continues our examination of eligibility for non-U.S. citizens to enter or remain in the country. This week focuses more closely on categories of immigrants -- guest workers, business employees, and family members, as well as temporary visitors such as students and tourists. Along with border security, these visa categories are at the center of current debates over immigration reform, given that the waiting time for some persons eligible to immigrate to the United States can reach decades. Recent proposals for immigration reform are noted here.The \"Green Card\" and a Broken Immigration SystemPermanent Residency through Family RelationshipCitizenship through Marriage and the Marriage Fraud ActImmigration through EmploymentRefugees and AsylumU.S. Immigration ReformWeek 5: Breaking the Rules: Deportation Proceedings and Border SecurityOur concluding week focuses upon the various grounds for deportation, deportation proceedings, and a brief overview of the U.S. immigration court system. Border security measures seek to protect the nation's security as well as public health and safety. Of particular interest is the \"extended border control\" capability of the Department of Homeland Security. Enhanced border security is one key to political compromise on immigration reform, providing a final opportunity in this course to consider the future direction of immigration law in the United States."}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Leading Strategic Innovation in Organizations", "cat": "3/business_management", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 274, "desc": "Improve your ability to manage creativity and to lead an innovation strategy in businesses, schools, hospitals, governments, and other complex organizations and institutions, by diagnosing likely innovation failures before they occur. This\ncourse is intended to help you improve your ability to manage creativity,\ninnovation and change in business, education, healthcare, government, and in\nany other complex organization or institution by diagnosing potential\ninnovation failures before they can occur. Using an \u201cinnovation constraints\u201d framework that draws on modern social\nscience research and on insights from business practice, participants will\nlearn how to best manage people (be they co-workers, bosses, customers,\nclients, friends or any other stakeholders) when innovation is the goal.&nbsp;\nWhile we see several examples of technological innovation, we are not focused\non the management of technology.&nbsp;\nInstead, we focus on something much more powerful:&nbsp; understanding and managing the people engaged\nin creation, innovation and positive change, regardless of the context. The course is\ndesigned to help you answer the following types of questions:\nWhat are the conditions for successful innovation?What causes innovation to fail?What makes creative people creative?How should I manage an innovative team?How do I lead an effective brainstorm process?What is an innovation portfolio and how can I manage one?Why do so many great ideas get killed?\nThe approach in this\nclass will be to treat innovation as the process of generating, assessing,\nand then implementing useful and valuable ideas.&nbsp; As we will\ndiscuss, generating ideas is relatively easy; what can be hard is getting those\nideas listened to, accepted, and implemented in organizations.&nbsp; In\naddition to learning how to lead creative people and creative teams, participants\nwill also learn techniques for improving their own creativity.&nbsp; During the\ncourse you will engage numerous activities and exercises intended to bring\ncurrent habits of thought and behavior to the surface for examination and\nchange.Syllabus\nWeek 1:&nbsp; Introduction:&nbsp; Why Everyone Wants Innovation but No One Wants to ChangeWe introduce the approach of the class:&nbsp; instead of trying to be innovative, just stop stopping it.&nbsp; We discuss a framework for analyzing the six most common barriers (constraints) that stop innovation.Week 2:&nbsp; Individual Constraints:&nbsp; Why Most of Us Are More Creative Than We ThinkPsychologists treat innovation as a problem of having creative ideas; we sometimes stop innovation by not \"thinking different\".&nbsp; This week explores the constraints of perception, intellection, and expression and offers strategies for overcoming them.Week 3:&nbsp; Group Constraints:&nbsp; Why a Brainstorm Meeting Can Be Worse Than No Meeting at AllSocial psychologists treat innovation as a group problem:&nbsp; we often don't get early support for our ideas because of adverse group dynamics.&nbsp; This week looks at the constraints of emotion, culture, and process in groups as well as the environment within which groups work, and looks at ways to overcome them.Week 4:&nbsp; Organizational Constraints:&nbsp; Why You\u2019ll Never Be a Prophet in Your Own HometownThe field of management sees the problem of innovation as one of the organization; organization is the opposite of innovation, after all.&nbsp; This week explores the constraints of strategy, structure, and resources and we explore ways of framing them that will help us to overcome them.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Week 5:&nbsp; Industry Constraints: If It\u2019s Such a Great Idea, Why Isn\u2019t Our Competitor Doing It?An economist view of failed innovation sees it as a problem of adoption; when there's no market to adopt it, it's not an innovation, it's just a creative idea.&nbsp; We look at the constraints of competition, suppliers, and markets and discuss strategies you can use to relax them.Week 6:&nbsp; Societal Constraints:&nbsp; Why My Innovation Means You Have to ChangeThe sociological and anthropological perspective suggests that societies control or obstruct innovations that are deemed as dangerous or contrary to societal values.&nbsp; This week explores the constraints of identity, social control, and history and we will seek an understanding of how we might avoid them. Week 7:&nbsp; Technological Constraints:&nbsp; How to Take a Really Hard Problem and Make It Completely ImpossibleEngineers and scientists see failed innovation as a failure of technology; if it doesn't work, it's not an innovation.&nbsp; Here we explore the constraints of knowledge, time, and the natural environment.&nbsp; Rather than trying to overcome them, we develop strategies for working within these constraints.Week 8:&nbsp; When Failure Is Not an Option: Leading an Innovation StrategyThe final week has us putting the entire model together into the leadership context.&nbsp; We will learn about innovation portfolios and discuss a tested process for moving innovations from ideas to realities.&nbsp; This animated video describes the basic issues addressed by the course. Recommended Background\nIdeally, participants will have had experience working in an organization. &nbsp;Management experience is a plus, but is not required. &nbsp;Suggested Readings\nI recommend &nbsp;that that students purchase to the book&nbsp;\"Creative People Must Be Stopped!\" which was written specifically for this course. &nbsp;Each chapter in the book corresponds to one week in the course.Course Format\nThe course will consist primarily of weekly&nbsp;video lectures with embedded quizzes, short exercises, readings, several diagnostic surveys, and a brief weekly&nbsp;reflection paper. In addition, and in recognition that not all participants have the same learning objectives or available time, the course is offered at two levels of engagement:&nbsp;Standard Level&nbsp; - Estimated Time Commitment: 6\u20138 Hours Per WeekStudents at this level receive a \u201cStatement of Accomplishment\u201d that certifies proficiency with the course concepts and framework.&nbsp; This track is designed for those who wish to engage the material by doing assignments,&nbsp;exercises and discussion board participation, however, who may not have the time to complete an innovation project.&nbsp;Distinction Level (Project Track)&nbsp;- Estimated Time Commitment: 8 \u2013 12+ Hours Per WeekStudents at this level will receive a&nbsp;\u201cStatement of Accomplishment - With Distinction&nbsp;that certifies mastery of the practice of the&nbsp;course content.&nbsp; Students will apply the material by completing an innovation project in a small team.&nbsp; This level is designed for those students wishing to achieve mastery of the course material and to understand its application in a real-world project context. FAQ\nCan you really teach people how to be creative and innovative?This course does not try teach people how to be creative.&nbsp; Rather, it teaches us how to stop stopping it.&nbsp; If we can do that, a person's natural creativity will easily bloom. What are the readings for the course and where are they available? Freely available readings will be assigned for each course session.&nbsp; I also recommend that students purchase the book&nbsp;\"Creative People Must Be Stopped!\" which was written specifically for this course.\nWhat are the course\nrequirements and deliverables?See next question.Will I get a certificate for completing the class?The short answer is yes.&nbsp; Read on for the long answer:In recognition that all participants will not\nhave the same goals or time to invest, the course is offered at three levels of\nengagement.&nbsp; Each level will receive a\ndifferent acknowledgement for completing the course.&nbsp; See the course syllabus for details.&nbsp; Also see \"Course Format\" section above for overview.What is the format of the class?The class will consist of lecture videos, assigned readings, and exercises.&nbsp; There will also be individual assignments and team assignments for those taking the advanced levels of the courseHow do the teams work (given that this is an online class)? For those taking the Studio Mastery track, participants will need to work in teams of two-to-five persons to complete the course project assignment.&nbsp; You are strongly encouraged to recruit other local participants to take the course if only to populate your project team. What if I don't have a team?&nbsp; How can I find a team to join? If you cannot find someone to take the course with you, you can post to the class website in order to recruit other team members.&nbsp; However, you will not be able to start on the assigned group exercises and project deliverables until you have formed and registered your team. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your own convenience. How much does it cost to take the course? The course is free.&nbsp; When assigned, readings will be available through links on the internet.&nbsp; See above for information on the recommended (but not required) textbook.How can I learn more about the course? This course is based on the popular Innovation Strategy class at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get a sense of how the course works, please check out the IdeaScale Site we use for managing ideas and projects, and the recommended textbook that was written for the course. &nbsp; Finally, this animated video describes the basic intellectual framework of the course."}

How was it created? How does it work? How do we secure communications on the Internet? The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today. What You Will Learn\nAfter this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Introduction to the Course and The Dawn of Electronic Computing (1940-1960)Week 2: The First Internet (1960-1990)Week 3: The World Wide Web (1990-1995)Week 4: Commercialization and Growth (1995-2000)Week 5: Internets and PacketsWeek 6: Transports and SecurityWeek 7: Networked ApplicationsWeek 8: Security - Protecting InformationWeek 9: Security - Establishing IdentityFinal ExamRecommended Background\nThis course has no prerequisites and there will be no programming.

This is not history just to memorize dates, places, and people's names so you can answer questions on an exam. The history of the Internet and the Web is not nearly as simple as it might seem on the surface. There are heroes who saved the day and villains who tried to keep the heroes from saving the day. There were complex engineering issues that needed to be solved in a hurry. By looking at what really happened and hearing directly from those who built it, we also learn about how humans work together to solve large, complex, and undefined problems. What is the format of the class? The course is about 60% recorded lectures and 40% video interviews with Internet pioneers. It will be comprised of a series of 10-30 minute segments with some assessment material at the end of each segment.

In this class, we will be studying, quite literally, everything in the universe. &nbsp;We will start with \"classical\" astronomy, describing the night sky and organizing what we see as was done in ancient times. &nbsp;We will then embark on a journey,\nstarting here on Earth and progressing outward, to study the Solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the wonderful and strange objects we observe in deep space, such as black holes, quasars, and supernovae. &nbsp;We will end with some discussion of what\nscientists know today about the universe as a whole. &nbsp;Along the way we will introduce some of the methods, theoretical and experimental, that have been used to understand all of this, from Newton's laws, through our understanding of light and matter,\nto Einstein's theory of relativity, and from Galileo's telescope to WMAP.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Positional Astronomy (naked-eye Astronomy)We will spend our first week familiarizing ourselves with descriptions of the positions and motions of celestial objects.Weeks 2-3: Newton\u2019s UniverseNewtonian physics revolutionized the way we understand our Universe. &nbsp;We will discuss Newton\u2019s laws of mechanics, the conservation laws that follow from them, his theory of gravity and some applications to Astronomy, as well as some properties of radiation. &nbsp;The last clip will be a quick look at the features of quantum mechanics relevant to our course. &nbsp;This will be a particularly busy and challenging unit, but hard work here will pay off later.Week 4: PlanetsWe will not have time in this course to do justice to the broad and exciting field of planetary science. &nbsp;We will spend the week on a general review of the properties and structure of our Solar System and our understanding of its origins and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;We will end with some discussion of the exciting discoveries over the past decade of many hundreds of extrasolar planets.Week 5: StarsWhat we know about stars and a bit about how we found out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will begin with a quick review of the best-studied star of all, our Sun. &nbsp;We will then talk about classifications; H-R diagrams and main sequence stars; distance, mass, and size measurements; binaries; clusters; and stellar evolution through the main sequenceWeek 6: Post-Main-Sequence StarsFinal stages of stellar evolution and stellar remnants. &nbsp;&nbsp;Giants, white dwarfs, novae, variable stars, supernovae, neutron stars and pulsars.Week 7: Relativity and Black HolesWe will spend most of this week acquiring an understanding of the special theory of relativity.&nbsp; We will then discuss the general theory in a qualitative way, and discuss its application to black holes, gravitational lensing, and other phenomena of interest.Week 8: GalaxiesGalactic structure and classification. &nbsp;Active galactic nuclei, quasars and blazars. &nbsp;Galactic rotation curves and dark matter. &nbsp;Galaxy clusters and large-scale structure.Weeks 9-10: CosmologyWhat we can say about the universe as a whole. &nbsp;Hubble Expansion. &nbsp;Big bang cosmology. The cosmic microwave background. &nbsp;Recent determination of cosmological parameters.&nbsp; Early universe physics.Recommended Background\nAn interest in learning something about the universe we live in and a willingness to invest some thought and some work in this.\nThe ability to calculate with large and small numbers, e.g. to compute the product of and .\nA familiarity with the rudiments of high-school algebra, the ability to solve an equation like to get &nbsp; and comfortably use this to obtain numerical values for in appropriate units given values of , , and , and to draw and use graphs to describe the properties of functions.\nA basic background in science at a high school level. What elements, atoms, nuclei, magnetic fields, gravity, etc. are will be assumed familiar. &nbsp;The details of their physics or its mathematical description will not.\nSuggested Readings\nThere are a lot of important and interesting facts to learn about astronomy, and lectures are a very inefficient way to learn facts. &nbsp;It would be extremely helpful, but not absolutely necessary, to read any of the many fine textbooks on introductory\nastronomy that are out there as you take this class and to have it handy as a reference.&nbsp; One example is \"Universe\" by Freedman, Geller, and Kaufmann - but there are many other comparable texts and I will not adhere strictly to any of them.&nbsp;\nThe Wikibook http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Astronomy and Wikipedia entries for topics mentioned in class would be quite sufficient for this purpose, as would the notes by Nick Strobel generously\navailable for free at http://www.astronomynotes.com/. In addition, I recommend (but do not require!) downloading and installing a planetarium application for your computer. &nbsp;Examples of free downloads sufficient\nfor our purposes include http://www.astrosurf.com/c2a/ &nbsp;(Windows only) or http://www.ap-i.net/skychart/.&nbsp;\nThe specific software I will use in lecture, http://astronomy.starrynight.com/&nbsp; will be available to students of the class at a discount price.\nCourse Format\nThere will be video lectures broken up into clips 8-15min. long, about three hours of video per week. There will be quizzes to go with these as well as regular homework assignments designed to help you gain a thorough understanding of the material.FAQ Will I get a&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;after completing this course? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;signed by the instructor. Do I need to have had college physics or calculus to take this course? No. If you have had any of these, you will find them helpful but it is definitely possible to do this class and enjoy it without them. Supplementary notes reviewing the technical aspects of the physical principles we use will be posted to help keep the class as self-contained as possible. Is this a hard course? It should be. If done right you will have learned in a few short weeks a lot of truly exciting science, and this will require putting in some time to work on it, and some hard thinking. It should also be a lot of fun. Do I need a telescope to take this course? No. I will suggest some observing projects for naked-eye observing and some for telescope observing. If you can find a darkish place to look up at the night sky this will be both rewarding and instructive, and a telescope can amplify both effects if you know how to use it. But not all of us have access to such locations or equipment, and installing one of the planetarium software options allows you to make \u201cobservations\" on your monitor. Will this help me improve my skills as an observer? Not directly. We will not spend much time on details of observational astronomy. We will focus more on the physical nature of astronomical objects. So the class might improve your knowledge of the object you observe, if not your observational technique.\n"}

Benjamin&nbsp;Cummings. This new edition can be difficult to find cheaply before Fall. Any older edition will work fine for this course.Another option is to use the free, online&nbsp;OpenStax Biology text.Course Format\nThere will be four&nbsp;units in the course. &nbsp;For the first three units, you will:Watch basics videos and take online quizzesAnswer short essay questions within the Peer Assessment toolStudy classic and current biological research projects and answer questions about them in the Peer Assessment toolThe fourth unit contains only videos and quizzes.&nbsp;FAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?Yes. Students who successfully complete this class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;from Coursera.The class is pretty easy, right? Because it's a \"preparation\" class?Actually, no. This class is&nbsp;quite difficult.As instructors for an introductory biology course for majors, we find students are good at memorizing, but struggle with problem-solving and working through puzzles. So we provide enough basics to allow us to ask really interesting, difficult questions for you to work on. If you pursue the Scholars Track, you will likely need to&nbsp;work together to answer the problems. This is how good students succeed at UC Irvine.Why are the quizzes timed?The quizzes are timed to encourage you to memorize the basic material before moving on to the next topic. You should be able to respond from memory, not from your notes.Is a book required or necessary?You will likely benefit from a reference biology book. The two most common options are:1. Campbell's \"Biology\" text by Pearson (go to the&nbsp;UCI Bookstore web page&nbsp;to purchase the custom edition if you are a UCI student)2. The free text \"Biology\" by OpenStax. This can be&nbsp;downloaded as a pdf or epub.Peer assessments are a pain. Why not use more quizzes?It's true that quizzes are common. But we have found that when a student has to&nbsp;justify&nbsp;their chosen answer, they find it difficult to explain why they chose \"B.\" Students often say \"it seemed like the best answer,\" or \"the other answers weren't as good.\" By having students write out an explanation for each option: \"B is true because...,\" they are FORCED to explain using biological terms why this is true and the others are not true.&nbsp;We've tried this technique both in the on-site introductory biology course AND in this course, and students agree that these activities caused them to learn more deeply.We have to make them peer-assessed because, well, there are 30,000 of you."}

This course explores the functioning of the unique creature that is the EU, the impact of its laws on states, citizens and companies, and the current challenges it faces. In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long contribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members \u2013 and deepen \u2013 from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the European integration project.\nThis course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, its institutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are established or provide services in the EU. In the final part, we will tackle Europe\u2019s common currency crisis, investigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existential crisis of the Union.\nIf you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply interested in the EU, its&nbsp;development and legal system, this course will provide you with the foundations.&nbsp;The course is of interest to people both inside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit from the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may learn from the EU\u2019s specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions being applied in the European context.FAQ\n1.

His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism. It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity. The Danish thinker S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.Syllabus\nPart 1: Kierkegaard on Socratic IronyWeek 1:\u00a0Course Introduction: The Life and Work of\nKierkegaard as a \u201cSocratic Task\u201dWeek 2: Kierkegaard,\nMartensen and Hegelianism at the University of CopenhagenWeek 3:\u00a0Kierkegaard\u2019s\nView of SocratesPart 2: Kierkegaard on\nRomantic IronyWeek 4:\u00a0Kierkegaard,\nHeiberg and HistoryWeek 5:\u00a0Kierkegaard,\nP.M.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Property and Liability: An Introduction to Law and Economics", "cat": "6/economics_finance|9/humanities|11/law", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 304, "desc": "Think about the oldest and most familiar principles of American law, property and proportional liability, in a new and surprising way, and learn to apply economic reasoning to an especially important and interesting aspect of life. One of the most interesting\nand important developments in social science since 1970 has been the\n\"discovery\" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great\ncommon law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the\nthousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property\nand contract provide the institutional\nscaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability\nsystems of tort and crime appear to\u00a0mimic market exchange in areas of human activity\nwhere free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This\ncourse seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close\ninvestigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of\nsome simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior\nbackground in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic\nconcepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,\nspecific topics in the law, including property, tort\u00a0and crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,\u00a0are considered. Each group of lectures will\nelaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions\u00a0to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and\nmodes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but\nthe questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject\u00a0that affects everyone\u00a0are challenging and\nprovocative.

The course will close on that date, and no quizzes will be accepted after 8 a.m. on Monday, March 31.\u00a0Recommended Background\nNo background is required; all are welcome!Suggested Readings\nThe lectures are designed to stand alone, and there are no required readings, though I will recommend some short, internet-accessible readings at various points in the course for students who are interested in pursuing some of the issues raised in the lectures more deeply. In addition, several judicial opinions are discussed throughout the course, and each of these is accompanied by a full citation in the lecture itself. It's easy to find these cases on many sites on the internet, and interested students are encouraged to find and read them for themselves.Course Format\nThis course consists of 39 lectures, each between 15 and 30 minutes in length.\u00a0The syllabus is divided into six parts, with five to eight lectures in each part, and we'll cover one part during each week of the course. Every lecture includes several easy, ungraded\u00a0questions to see whether you've understood what you've just heard, and if you find yourself unable to answer one\u00a0of these correctly, you can simply\u00a0listen to that segment of the lecture again to find the answer, or skip the question and continue the lecture. Along with each of the six parts of the syllabus\u00a0comes a set of questions and simple problems separate from the lectures\u00a0to help you\u00a0think about\u00a0the lecture material a little more deeply. These six exercises are called \"quizzes.\" To earn the Statement of Accomplishment, you must complete all six of the quizzes and keep working on them until you reach a score of 75% correct on each quiz. \u00a0FAQ\n* Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?Yes. Students who complete all six quizzes with a grade of 75% or higher by March 31, 2014 will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor that confirms that they have successfully completed&nbsp;the course. Because the course is meant to be as accessible and enjoyable for as many people as possible, it is not intended to be competitive. Students may submit each quiz as many times as needed to achieve a grade of 75% or higher, and grades of Distinction will not be given.&nbsp;* What resources will I need for this class?Nothing but an internet connection, an open mind, and a willingness to think about things in new ways."}

The Positive and Negative Emotional Attractors inspire sustained, desired change and learning at many levels. Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships. They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness, hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress. But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.\nBased on decades of&nbsp;research into emotional intelligence&nbsp;competencies and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine resonance and developing \"resonant leadership\" capability,&nbsp;emotional intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion. Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological research, participants will&nbsp;understand the theory, research, and experience of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained, desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities.&nbsp;The course will consist of nine classes, with three or so\nmodules per class, to be taken over 8 weeks. Each module will consist of a\nvideo, assigned and recommended readings, reflective exercises, writing in your\nPersonal Journal, and on-line, asynchronous discussions.

However, the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students, graduate students or professionals and executives. Therefore, for all participants, reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable.&nbsp;Suggested Readings\nStudents should read the required readings either before or soon after each unit, but in advance of the next module. Recommended and supplemental readings can be read at any time throughout the course.&nbsp;Course Format\nThis course is made up of nine classes. Each class has two to four modules. Each module has a video, plus reflective exercises to be done during the module and a personal learning assignment to follow the class. Students are encouraged to maintain a personal journal of thoughts, observations and experiences during the course. For the advanced Practicum Track, there are 3 action learning assignments which involve you talking to others at work, home, or other aspects of your life. For example, the action learning assignment after Class 5 requires that you conduct two coaching sessions and write a brief essay on them. If you choose this option, these will be read and reviewed by a small group of classmates on-line. Students are expected to offer their opinions, ideas and examples from the videos, readings, personal and action learning exercises, and reflective exercises in on line discussions. Each week &nbsp;will end with a quiz. The final grade will be based on 5 Personal Learning Assignments (60%), 5 weekly exams (20%), and the Final exam (20%).

{"lang": "en", "name": "Linear and Integer Programming", "cat": "", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 308, "desc": "This course will cover the very basic ideas in optimization. Topics include the basic theory and algorithms behind linear and integer linear programming along with some of the important applications. We will also explore the theory of convex polyhedra using linear programming. Linear Programming (LP) is arguably one of the most important optimization problems in applied mathematics and engineering. The Simplex algorithm to solve linear programs is widely regarded as one among the \"top ten\"&nbsp;algorithms of the 20th century. Linear Programs arise in almost all fields of engineering including operations research, statistics, machine learning, control system design, scheduling, formal verification&nbsp;and computer vision. It forms the basis for numerous approaches to solving hard combinatorial optimization problems through randomization and approximation.The primary goals of this course&nbsp;will be to:1. Understand the basic theory behind LP, algorithms to solve LPs, and the basics of (mixed) integer programs (ILP).2. Understand important and emerging applications of LP and ILPs to economic problems (optimal resource allocation, scheduling problems), machine learning (SVM), and combinatorial optimization problems.At the end of the course, the successful student will be able to cast various problems that may arise in her research as optimization problems, understand the cases where the optimization problem will be linear, choose appropriate solution methods and interpret results appropriately. This is generally considered a useful ability in many research areas.Syllabus\nIntroductory Material&nbsp;Introduction to Linear Programming.Week #1:&nbsp;The Diet Problem.Linear Programming Formulations.Tutorials on using GLPK (AMPL), Matlab, CVX and Microsft Excel.The Simplex Algorithm (basics).Week #2:&nbsp;Handling unbounded problemsDegeneracyGeometry of SimplexInitializing Simplex.Cycling and the Use of Bland's rule.Week #3:Duality: dual variables and dual linear program.Strong duality theorem.Complementary Slackness.&nbsp;KKT conditions for Linear Programs.Understanding the dual problem: shadow costs.Extra: The revised simplex method.Week #4:&nbsp;Advanced LP formulations: norm optimization.Least squares, and quadratic programming.Applications #1: Signal reconstruction and De-noising.Applications #2: Regression.Week #5:&nbsp;Integer Linear Programming.Integer vs. Real-valued variables.NP-completeness: basic introduction.Reductions from Combinatorial Problems (SAT, TSP and Vertex Cover).Approximation Algorithms: Introduction.Week #6:Branch and Bound MethodCutting Plane MethodWeek #7:Applications: solving puzzles (Sudoku), reasoning about systems and other applications.Classification and Machine LearningRecommended Background\nMathematical Maturity (undergraduate algorithms or CS theory) and basic programming ability. A background in engineering or applied sciences could be useful, as well.The prerequisites for this class include:Basic College Level mathematics:&nbsp;calculus and some linear algebra: matrices, matrix operations and solving linear equations.Programming skills:&nbsp; However, &nbsp; students without a programming background &nbsp;can pass the course by solving all the weekly assignments.Suggested Readings\nTextbook:&nbsp;Linear Programming by Robert J. Vanderbei (available online &nbsp;from author's webpage).Alternative:&nbsp;Linear Programming by Vasek Chvatal, W.H. Freeman&nbsp;published, 1983. This book still remains a very clear and concise presentation.&nbsp;Other texts: We may borrow material that is covered in some of the&nbsp;texts below. As you go down this list, the texts become less relevant for this class but remain very important for the broader field of optimization that we seek to introduce through this class.Combinatorial optimization: Algorithms &amp; Complexity, by Christos Papadimitrou and Ken Steglitz.Linear Programming&nbsp;series of two books&nbsp;by G.B. Danzig and M.K. Thapa.Schrijver's book on the Theory of Integer Linear Programming and Integer, Integer and&nbsp;Combinatoral Optimization book by Wolsey and&nbsp;Nemhauser are also good references.&nbsp;Convex Optimization by Boyd and Vandenbreghe is a good reference for the more general area of convex optimization.Numerical Optimization by Nocedal and Wright is a great reference for solving non-linear optimization problems.&nbsp;Course Format\nEach class will consist of many short lecture videos between 10-15 minutes in length with nearly 1.5-2 hours of &nbsp;lectures each week. We will have weekly assignments involving 5-10 problems each week. These assignments will either be multiple choice or ask you to compute something and enter the answer. We will have four programming assignments (one every two weeks) that will incrementally help you build an ILP solver. Programming assignments can be done in virtually any general purpose language.The course will be structured with two interactive tracks: algorithms/theory for linear optimization problems and applications. The applications will include ideas on modeling real-life optimization problems as linear programs and the appropriate use of concepts like duality in finding and interpreting solutions.FAQ\nWill I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?Yes.What textbooks will I need for this class?No textbook is officially required. However, there are numerous great textbooks on this topic. We are hoping you will be able to find one. You can always cross check whether your textbook has adequate coverage for the topics to be taught in this class.&nbsp;We recommend a great textbook&nbsp;by Prof.&nbsp;Vanderbei (see http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/LPbook/). It is available as a free download.&nbsp;The classic book by Chvatal&nbsp;is an&nbsp;excellent textbook but sadly out-of-print.&nbsp;What are the pre-requisites?The prerequisites for this class include:Basic College Level mathematics: calculus and some knowledge of linear algebra.Some programming skills:&nbsp; However, &nbsp; students without a programming background &nbsp;can pass the course by solving the weekly assignments.What will the level of the class be?Normally, this will be a junior/senior level undergraduate class or even a beginning graduate class, depending on the major and the university. A highly motivated high school student with advanced mathematical skills can follow along.What skills will I learn?The class is about Linear and Integer Programming. You will definitely learn:what optimization problems are, what are linear optimization problems, what are the applications, what are the algorithms used for solving LPs, and how do they work?In addition, we found through our previous offering in 2013 that the course helps many students think mathematically and improve the programming skills. We were proud of the many students from last year&nbsp;who took on some of the challenging programming assignments and reported a big confidence boost in their skills.Can I get university course credits for this class?Unfortunately, not at this time. University of Colorado, Boulder may be&nbsp;considering ways of recognizing Coursera classes,&nbsp;but there is no consensus at this point in time.However, Prof. Sankaranarayanan teaches an on-campus class (CSCI 5654) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and it will be available simultaneously on-line for credit through CAETE (see&nbsp;http://cuengineeringonline.colorado.edu/&nbsp;). You can enroll for our class CSCI 5654 through CAETE from anywhere in the world.&nbsp;Are we going to do rigorous mathematical proofs? How much programming do you expect to do?&nbsp;We will cover proofs for interested students. But we will never have proofs in the assignments.Assignments will test the conceptual ideas in the class including algorithms, and many assignments may ask you to use an existing LP solver (open source or commercial) to solve a LP/ILP and interpret its answer. We do not consider this part as programming: any computer user&nbsp;should be able to manage this.We will have programming assignments: in fact, students will get to build their own LP and later ILP solver in stages. But the programming is not going to be for everyone. The last assignment (ILP) will be quite intense and definitely challenging to students.Is there a particular programming language that you expect for the assignments?No. We will allow students to program in most general purpose languages. However, by the very nature of the assignments, some languages such as python, C/C++, Java, Haskell, Scheme, Lisp, MATLAB/Octave, ... will be more suitable than others. You can judge for yourselves as soon as the assignments are posted on week 1.What will the coursework involve?Coursework will involve watching videos, solving weekly assignments and tackling four programming assignments. See below on how the grading will work.&nbsp;How do I pass? How does distinction work?To pass the class: you will need to get at least 35% of the total grade. &nbsp;The pass cutoff is &nbsp;designed so that students can pass either by solving some/all of the programming assignments OR by solving some/all of the weekly assignments.&nbsp;To score a distinction: you will need to get at least 85% of the total grade. To score a distinction, students must do well in ALL aspects of the course: programming as well as weekly assignments."}

Learn how contemporary artists, animators and gamers work from the art of the past as part of their creative process, while building your own skills in visual analysis and creative and critical thinking. This course approaches the questions of \u201cart\u201d and \u201chistory\u201d from the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting, photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whether character/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists actively make a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative process as a \u201cconversation\u201d with a wide range of art from the past. Why are ground-breaking artists so often historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional history-telling)? How do animators themselves \u201cwrite\u201d the largely unwritten history of their art through quotation, transposition and mash-ups?

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nWhat resources will I need for this class? You will need an internet connection, a 9x12 sketchbook and materials of your choice (pencil, pens, photos and other collage materials), a camera or other digital image recorder, and time enough to look, read and think. Each student will be encouraged to make use of local resources, including museums, galleries and libraries. &nbsp;Selected readings will be available for free. An optional reading list will suggest books for purchase. Why should I take this class? Visual media is all around us--it's as much our \"real world\" as is our physical surroundings. &nbsp;As an artist, you need to understand how looking at and responding to art is a critical part of the creative process. As a member of the media sphere, it's important to be a critical viewer. Otherwise, you're just being \"sold.\"\nWhat can I do to prepare for this class? Be curious and interested in the world around you. Go to as many film screenings, art exhibitions and events as you can. Keep a sketchbook, if you don't already. Read. Make work.

In this class you will learn how to make this happen, from the simplest machine learning algorithms to quite sophisticated ones. Enjoy! Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and cost-effective when manual programming is not. Machine learning (also known as data mining, pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business, industry, science and government, and &nbsp;there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful!Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work.In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering, clickstream mining, recommender systems, and computational biology. This will get you as close to becoming a machine learning expert as you can in ten weeks!Syllabus\nWeek One: Basic concepts in machine learning.Week Two: Decision tree induction.Week Three: Learning sets of rules and logic programs.Week Four: Instance-based learning.Week Five: Statistical learning.Week Six: Neural networks.Week Seven: Model ensembles.Week Eight: Learning theory.Week Nine: Support vector machines.Week Ten: Clustering and dimensionality reduction.Recommended Background\nThe main prerequisite for this class is basic knowledge of programming. Some previous exposure to probability, statistics, linear algebra, calculus and/or logic is useful but not essential.Suggested Readings\nThe class is self-contained, but a good complement to it is the book Machine Learning, by Tom Mitchell, published by McGraw-Hill. This covers most but not all of the topics in the class. The remaining topics can be found in Pattern Classification&nbsp;(second edition), by Duda, Hart and Stork (Wiley), and other textbooks.Course Format\nThe class will consist of a series of lecture videos, typically 5 to 15 minutes in length. Each video contains a few integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures, programming assignments, and a final exam.FAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.What resources will I need for this class?&nbsp;You will need access to a computer with a compiler/environment for the programming language of your choice.&nbsp;What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?Machine learning is the scientific method on steroids. It follows the same process of generating, testing, and discarding or refining hypotheses. But, while a scientist may spend her whole life coming up with and testing a few hundred hypotheses, a machine learning system can do the same in a fraction of a second."}

And governments all around the world try to shape those forces in ways that (hopefully) improve the lives of their constituents. In this subject, we will examine the major theories used by macro economists to analyse national economies and the international economy. In this course,\nwe will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide\neconomists\u2019 and policy makers\u2019 understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics\nis a word derived from the Greek prefix \u201cmakros\u201d, meaning large. It is the study\nof economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the\neconomic management role played by governments and international organisations.\nThe founder of\nmodern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote\n\u201cThe ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right\nand when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,\nthe world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be\nquite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some\ndefunct economist.\u201d This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the\ninfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,\nunemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.\nWe will cover\nimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment\nand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid\nthe foundation for governments\u2019 active management of the macroeconomy in the\npost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal\npolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; Economists\u2019 approaches to the analysis of\nlong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be\ncritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate\nand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not\nshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic\ntheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach\ntheir task.

Cybercrime has become both more widespread and harder to battle. Researchers and anecdotal\nexperience show that the cybercrime scene is becoming increasingly organized\nand consolidated, with strong links also to traditional criminal networks.\nModern attacks are indeed stealthy and often profit oriented.\nMalicious software (malware) is the traditional way in which cybercriminals infect user\nand enterprise hosts to gain access to their private, financial, and\nintellectual property data. Once stolen, such information can enable more\nsophisticated attacks, generate illegal revenue, and allow for cyber-espionage.\nBy mixing a practical, hands-on approach with the theory and techniques behind the scene, the course discusses the current academic and underground research in the\nfield, trying to answer the foremost question about malware and underground\neconomy, namely, \"Should we care?\".\u00a0Students will learn how traditional and mobile malware work, how they are analyzed and\ndetected, peering through the underground ecosystem that drives this profitable\nbut illegal business.\nUnderstanding how malware operates is of paramount importance to form knowledgeable experts, teachers, researchers, and practitioners able to fight back. Besides, it allows us to gather intimate knowledge of the systems and the threats, which is a necessary step to successfully devise novel, effective, and practical mitigation techniques.Syllabus\nWeek One: Introduction to Malicious SoftwareWeek Two: (A Glimpse at) Static Analysis and its LimitationWeek Three: (A Glimpse at) Dynamic Analysis and its LimitationWeek Four: Introduction to Mobile Malware ThreatsWeek Five: Specialized Underground CybercrimeWeek Six: Cybercrime economy (and its costs)Recommended Background\nOperating Systems, Computer Architecture, Computer Security Class (optional)Course Format\nThe course materials will\nincorporate video/audio learning content with formative assessments and the addition\nof hands-on challenges to be completed by the students as self-assessed study.FAQ\nHow does this differ from a Computer Security class?\u00a0\u201cComputer Security\u201d is more focused on teaching students how to design and build secure systems and write secure code. To this end, traditional software vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques are presented, leading eventually to a discussion of malware. Conversely, while such a class will likely touch on some software vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques too for completeness (as those are often the prelude to a malware infection nowadays), the overall goal here is at focusing on the analysis and detection of (traditional and mobile) malicious software, peering also through the underground ecosystem linked to it.

School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box \u2013 a valuable ability in today\u2019s world.

The only heavy use of these topics is in the (optional) final two weeks of the Extended Course.A good way to assess if your basic school background is adequate (even if currently rusty) is to glance at the topics in the book Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics\u00a0(free download), published by the US National Academies Press in 2001. Though aimed at K-8 mathematics teachers and teacher educators, it provides an excellent coverage of what constitutes a good basic mathematics education for life in the Twenty-First Century (which was the National Academies' aim in producing it).Suggested Readings\nThere is one reading assignment at the start, providing some motivational background.\nThere is a supplemental reading unit describing elementary set theory for students who are not familiar with the material.\nThere is a course textbook, Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, by Keith Devlin, available at low cost (US base price $10.99)&nbsp;from Amazon, in hard copy and Kindle versions, but it is not required in order to complete the course.For general background on mathematics and its role in the modern world, take a look at the five week&nbsp;survey course on mathematics (\"Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible\") Devlin gave at Stanford in fall 2012, available for free download&nbsp;from iTunes University (Stanford), and on YouTube (1, 2, 3, 4, 5),&nbsp;particularly the first halves of&nbsp;lectures 1 and 4.Course Format\nThe Basic Course lasts for eight weeks, comprising ten lectures, each with a problem-based work assignment (ungraded, designed for group work), a weekly Problem Set (machine graded), and weekly tutorials in which the instructor will go over some of the assignment and Problem Set questions from the previous week. The Extended Course consists of the Basic Course followed by a more intense\u00a0two weeks exercise called Test Flight. Whereas the focus in the Basic Course is the development of mathematically-based thinking skills for everyday life, the focus in Test Flight is on applying those skills to mathematics itself.\u00a0FAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?\nThe course does not carry Stanford credit. If you complete the Basic Course with more than a minimal aggregate mark, you will get a Statement of Accomplishment. If you go on to complete the Extended Course with more than a minimal mark, you will receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.\nWhat are the assignments for this class?\nAt the end of each lecture, you will be given an assignment (as a downloadable PDF file, released at the same time as the lecture) that is intended to guide understanding of what you have learned. Worked solutions to problems from the assignments will be described the following week in a video tutorial session given by the instructor.\nUsing the worked solutions as guidance, together with input from other students, you will self-grade your assignment work for correctness. The assignments are for understanding and development, not for grade points. You are strongly encouraged to discuss your work with others before, during, and after the self-grading process. These assignments (and the self-grading) are the real heart of the course. The only way to learn how to think mathematically is to keep trying to do so, comparing your performance to that of an expert and discussing the issues with fellow students.\nIs there a final exam for this course?\nNo. The Test Flight exercise in the final two weeks of the Extended Course is built around a Problem Set similar to those used throughout the course, and your submission will be peer evaluated by other students, but the focus is on the process of evaluation itself, with the goal of developing the ability to judge mathematical arguments presented by others. Whilst not an exam, Test Flight is an intense and challenging capstone experience, and is designed to prepare students for further study of university level mathematics.\nHow is this course graded?\nIn the Basic Course, grades are awarded for the weekly Problem Sets, which are machine graded. The aggregate grade is provided in the cover note to the Statement of Accomplishment, with an explanation of its significance within the class. In the Extended Course, additional grades are awarded for\u00a0a series of proof evaluation exercises and for\u00a0the Test Flight Problem Set (peer evaluated). The aggregate grade is provided in the cover note to the Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction, with an explanation of its significance within the class.\n"}

Learn why knowledge of human neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neural plasticity, and new discovery in the brain sciences matters for clinical practice in the health professions. Medical Neuroscience explores the organization and physiology of the human central nervous system. This course is designed for first-year students in graduate-level health professions programs. It builds upon knowledge acquired in prior studies of cellular and molecular biology, general physiology, and human anatomy. The course provides students an understanding of the essential principles of neurological function, from cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural signaling and plasticity to the organization and function of sensory and motor systems. This course emphasizes the neural and vascular anatomy of the human brain and spinal cord, providing an anatomical framework for localizing lesions within the central nervous system. It also emphasizes the neurobiological foundation for understanding cognition, mental illness and disorders of human behavior. The overall goal is to equip students in the health professions for interpreting impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany neurological injury, disease or dysfunction. Students currently pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences will benefit from this course by learning the fundamentals of functional human neuroanatomy and how neuroscience discovery translates to clinical practice. &nbsp;Health professionals will benefit from the opportunity to review and update knowledge of foundational medical neuroscience.Syllabus\nThis course comprises four units of content:Unit 1 Neuroanatomy. This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.Unit 2 Neural signaling. This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.Unit 3 Sensory systems. Here, you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us: somatic sensory systems,&nbsp;proprioception,&nbsp;vision, audition, and balance senses.Unit 4 Motor systems. In this unit, we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement.Unit 5 Brain Development. Next, we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.Unit 6 Cognition. The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state.Recommended Background\nTo be successful in this course, a college-level background in cellular and molecular biology and general knowledge of systems physiology and human anatomy is strongly recommended.Suggested Readings\nAlthough the course is designed to be self-contained for students with the recommended background, students wanting to expand their knowledge and reinforce their understanding are strongly encouraged to complete all recommended readings. &nbsp;The primary reference text for this course is Neuroscience, 5th Ed., by Purves et al. (Sinauer Assoc., Inc.). &nbsp;This text is bundled with neuroanatomical software, &nbsp;Sylvius 4 Online: An Interactive Atlas and Visual Glossary of Human Neuroanatomy, (also available as a standalone subscription).Course Format\nThe course consists of video tutorials delivered by Professor White, a neuroscientist, educator, and course director in the Duke University School of Medicine. Typically, these videos contain 1 or more integrated multiple-choice questions. Regular quizzes and application experiences focused on functional neuroanatomy and problem-solving through clinical case studies will assist students in keeping pace with course content. An exam focused on clinical neuroanatomy will be administered in the final few weeks of the course, and a comprehensive final exam is administered at the conclusion of the course. Learning will be supported by recommended textbook readings and interactive activities using digital atlases of the human brain and spinal cord. Each video tutorial will be accompanied by tutorial notes that will guide learning.FAQ\nWill I get a&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;for completing this course?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;signed by the instructor.\nWho should enroll in this course?\nYou should take this course if you are currently enrolled in a health professions curriculum or are preparing to do so having satisfied the usual prerequisites. This course is designed to provide you with the foundational knowledge you will need in basic neuroscience and clinical neuroanatomy. If you are pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences or a related biomedical or bioengineering field, then you will take away an understanding of human brain anatomy and insight into how ongoing discovery in neuroscience is shaping clinical practice. &nbsp;If you are a health professional, this course will provide a productive means for reviewing and updating your knowledge or foundational neuroscience. &nbsp;Lastly, if you are simply curious about the structure and function of the human brain, but have no aspirations to apply this knowledge in the health or research professions, you too can have an engaging and fulfilling experience, provided that you are willing to commit to all assigned readings, videos, and assessments.Should I enroll in Medical Neuroscience or Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action?\nif you are currently enrolled in a health professions curriculum or are preparing to do so having satisfied the usual prerequisites, then you should take Medical Neuroscience. This course is designed to provide you with the foundational knowledge you will need in basic neuroscience and clinical neuroanatomy for success in the health professions. Moreover, it is longer, more comprehensive, and more consistent with the rigors of medical education than the shorter course derived from this content, Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action. On the other hand, if your interests are not so clinical or if you are mainly looking for foundational knowledge of how the brain works at the levels of cells, synapses, circuits and sensorimotor systems, then Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action is for you. Or maybe you just don't have 12 weeks to devote to an intense medical-school caliber course; then, the shorter course is the better option. Either way, both courses fulfill the requirements for our specialization.\nWhat is the intellectual difficulty of this course?\nThe intellectual challenge and content level of this course is comparable to what first-year students in the graduate-level health professions would experience. &nbsp;This is why the course is expected to require 16-20 hours per week of effort.\nIs there a required textbook for this course?\nYou can be successful in this course without acquiring Neuroscience, 5th Ed. However, your experience will be significantly enhanced if you acquire the text and complete all recommended readings and learning activities using the bundled neuroanatomical software.\n"}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Model Thinking", "cat": "6/economics_finance|9/humanities", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 328, "desc": "In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us. We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.\nWhy do models make us better thinkers?\nModels help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.\nHere's how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!Subtitles for&nbsp;all video lectures available in: English, Chinese (provided by&nbsp;Yeeyan),&nbsp;Ukrainian (Pinchuk Foundation), and Turkish (provided by Turkcell Akademi).This course is also available in Chinese. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to visit the translated version of Model Thinking.Syllabus\nThis course will consist of twenty sections. As the course proceeds, I will fill in the descriptions of the topics and put in readings.Section 1: Introduction: Why Model?In these lectures, I describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course. These reasons fall into four broad categories:To be an intelligent citizen of the worldTo be a clearer thinkerTo understand and use dataTo better decide, strategize, and designThere are two readings for this section. These should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos.The Model Thinker: Prologue, Introduction and Chapter 1Why Model? by Joshua EpsteinSection 2: Sorting and Peer EffectsWe now jump directly into some models. We contrast two types of models that explain a single phenomenon, namely that people tend to live and interact with people who look, think, and act like themselves. After an introductory lecture, we cover famous models by Schelling and Granovetter that cover these phenomena. We follows those with a fun model about standing ovations that I wrote with my friend John Miller.In this second section, I show a computational version of Schelling's Segregation Model using NetLogo. Netlogo is free software authored by Uri Wilensky or Northwestern University. I will be using NetLogo several times during the course. It can be downloaded here:NetLogoThe Schelling Model that I use can be found by clicking on the \"File\" tab, then going to \"Models Library\". In the Models Library directory, click on the arrow next to the Social Science folder and then scroll down and click on the model called Segregation.The readings for this section include some brief notes on Schelling's model and then the academic papers of Granovetter and Miller and Page. I'm not expecting you to read those papers from start to end, but I strongly encourage you to peruse them so that you can see how social scientists frame and interpret models.Notes on SchellingGranovetter ModelMiller and Page ModelSection 3: AggregationIn this section, we explore the mysteries of aggregation, i.e. adding things up. We start by considering how numbers aggregate, focusing on the Central Limit Theorem. We then turn to adding up rules. We consider the Game of Life and one dimensional cellular automata models. Both models show how simple rules can combine to produce interesting phenomena. Last, we consider aggregating preferences. Here we see how individual preferences can be rational, but the aggregates need not be.There exist many great places on the web to read more about the Central Limit Theorem, the Binomial Distribution, Six Sigma, The Game of LIfe, and so on. I've included some links to get you started. The readings for cellular automata and for diverse preferences are short excerpts from my books&nbsp;Complex Adaptive Social Systems&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Difference&nbsp;Respectively.Central Limit TheoremBinomial DistributionSix SigmaCellular Automata1Cellular Automata2Diverse PreferencesSection 4: Decision ModelsIn this section, we study some models of how people make decisions. We start by considering multi criterion decision making. We then turn to spatial models of decision making and then decision trees. We conclude by looking at the value of information..The reading for multi-criterion decision making will be my guide for the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative. It provides a case study for how to use this technique. For spatial voting and decision models, there exist many great power point presentations and papers on the web. The Decision Tree writings are from Arizona State University's Craig Kirkwood.Multi Criterion Decision Making Case StudySpatial ModelsDecision TheorySection 5: Models of People: Thinking ElectronsIn this section, we study various ways that social scientists model people. We study and contrast three different models. The&nbsp;rational actor&nbsp;approach,behavioral models&nbsp;, and&nbsp;rule based models&nbsp;. These lectures provide context for many of the models that follow. There's no specific reading for these lectures though I mention several books on behavioral economics that you may want to consider. Also, if you find the race to the bottom game interesting just type \"Rosemary Nagel Race to the Bottom\" into a search engine and you'll get several good links. You can also find good introductions to \"Zero Intelligence Traders\" by typing that in as well.Here is a link to a brief primer on behavioral economics that has more references.Short Primer on Behavioral EconomicsSection 6: Linear ModelsIn this section, we cover linear models. We start by looking at categorical models, in which data gets binned into categories. We use this simple framework to introduce measures like mean, variance, and R-squared. We then turn to linear models describing what linear models do, how to read regression output (a valuable skill!) and how to fit nonlinear data with linear models. These lectures are meant to give you a \"feel\" for how linear models are used and perhaps to motivate you to take a course on these topics. I conclude this section by highlighting a distinction between what I call Big Coefficient thinking and New Reality thinking. The readings for this section consist of two short pieces written by me, but you can find abundant resources on the web on linear models, R-squared, regression, and evidence based thinking.Categorical ModelsLinear ModelsSection 7: Tipping PointsIn this section, we cover tipping points. We focus on two models. A percolation model from physics that we apply to banks and a model of the spread of diseases. The disease model is more complicated so I break that into two parts. The first part focuses on the diffusion. The second part adds recovery. The readings for this section consist of two excerpts from the book I'm writing on models. One covers diffusion. The other covers tips. There is also a technical paper on tipping points that I've included in a link. I wrote it with PJ Lamberson and it will be published in the&nbsp;Quarterly Journal of Political Science. I've included this to provide you a glimpse of what technical social science papers look like. You don't need to read it in full, but I strongly recommend the introduction. It also contains a wonderful reference list.Tipping PointsDIffusion and SISLamberson and Page: Tipping Points (READ INTRO ONLY)Section 8: Economic GrowthIn this section, we cover several models of growth. We start with a simple model of exponential growth and then move on to models from economics, with a focus on Solow's basic growth model. I simplify the model by leaving out the labor component. These models help us distinguish between two types of growth: growth that occurs from capital accumulation and growth that occurs from innovation.Growth ModelsSection 9: Diversity and InnovationIn this section, we cover some models of problem solving to show the role that diversity plays in innovation. We see how diverse perspectives (problem representations) and heuristics enable groups of problem solvers to outperform individuals. We also introduce some new concepts like \"rugged landscapes\" and \"local optima\". In the last lecture, we'll see the awesome power of recombination and how it contributes to growth. The readings for this chapters consist on an excerpt from my book&nbsp;The Difference&nbsp;courtesy of Princeton University Press.Diversity and Problem SolvingSection 10: Markov ProcessesIn this section, we cover Markov Processes. Markov Processes capture dynamic processes between a fixed set of states. For example, we will consider a process in which countries transition between democratic and dictatorial. To be a Markov Process, it must be possible to get from any one state to any other and the probabilities of moving between states must remain fixed over time. If those assumptions hold, then the process will have a unique equilibrium. In other words, history will not matter. Formally, this result is called the Markov Convergence Theorem. In addition to covering Markov Processes, we will also see how the basic framework can be used in other applications such as determining authorship of a text and the efficacy of a drug protocol.Markov ProcessesSection 11: Lyapunov FunctionsModels can help us to determine the nature of outcomes produced by a system: will the system produce an equilibrium, a cycle, randomness, or complexity? In this set of lectures, we cover Lyapunov Functions. These are a technique that will enable us to identify many systems that go to equilibrium. In addition, they enable us to put bounds on how quickly the equilibrium will be attained. In this set of lectures, we learn the formal definition of Lyapunov Functions and see how to apply them in a variety of settings. We also see where they don't apply and even study a problem where no one knows whether or not the system goes to equilibrium or not.Lyapunov FunctionsSection 12: Coordination and CultureIn this set of lectures, we consider some models of culture. We begin with some background on what culture is and why it's so important to social scientists. In the analytic section, we begin with a very simple game called the pure coordination game In this game, the players win only if they choose the same action. Which action they choose doesn't matter -- so long as they choose the same one. For example, whether you drive on the left or the right side of the road is not important, but what is important is that you drive on the same side as everyone else. We then consider situations in which people play multiple coordination games and study the emergence of culture. In our final model, we include a desire consistency as well as coordination in a model that produces the sorts of cultural signatures seen in real world data. The readings for this section include some of my notes on coordination games and then the Bednar et al academic paper. In that paper, you see how we used Markov Processes to study the model. There is also a link to the Axelrod Net Logo Model.Coordination GamesBednar et al. 2010Axelrod Culture Model in NetlogoSection 13: Path DependenceIn this set of lectures, we cover path dependence. We do so using some very simple urn models. The most famous of which is the Polya Process. These models are very simple but they enable us to unpack the logic of what makes a process path dependent. We also relate path dependence to increasing returns and to tipping points. The reading for this lecture is a paper that I wrote that is published in the&nbsp;Quarterly Journal of Political SciencePath DependenceSection 14: NetworksIn this section, we cover networks. We discuss how networks form, their structure -- in particular some common measures of networks -- and their function. Often, networks exhibit functions that emerge, but that we mean that no one intended for the functionality but it arises owing to the structure of the network. The reading for this section is a short article by Steven Strogatz.StrogatzSection 15:Randomness and Random WalksIn this section, we first discuss randomness and its various sources. We then discuss how performance can depend on skill and luck, where luck is modeled as randomness. We then learn a basic random walk model, which we apply to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the ideas that market prices contain all relevant information so that what's left is randomness. We conclude by discussing finite memory random walk model that can be used to model competition. The reading for this section is a paper on distinguishing skill from luck by Michael Mauboussin.Mauboussin: Skill vs LuckSection 16: The Colonel Blotto GameIn this section, we cover the Colonel Blotto Game. This game was originally developed to study war on multiple fronts. It's now applied to everything from sports to law to terrorism. We will discuss the basics of Colonel Blotto, move on to some more advanced analysis and then contrast Blotto with our skill luck model from the previous section. The readings for this section are an excerpt from my book&nbsp;The Difference&nbsp;and a paper that I wrote with Russell Golman of Carnegie Mellon. You need only read the first four pages of the Golman paper.Blotto from&nbsp;The DifferenceGolman Page: General BlottoSection 17:The Prisoners' Dilemma and Collective ActionIn this section, we cover the Prisoners' Dilemma, Collective Action Problems and Common Pool Resource Problems. We begin by discussion the Prisoners' Dilemma and showing how individual incentives can produce undesirable social outcomes. We then cover seven ways to produce cooperation. Five of these will be covered in the paper by Nowak and Sigmund listed below. We conclude by talking about collective action and common pool resource problems and how they require deep careful thinking to solve. There's a wonderful piece to read on this by the Nobel Prize winner Elinor OstromThe Prisoners' Dilemma in the&nbsp;Stanford Encyclopedia of PhilosophyNowak and Sigmund: Five Ways to CooperateOstrom: Going Beyond PanaceasSection 18: Mechanism Design: AuctionsIn this section, we cover mechanism design. We begin with some of the basics: how to overcome problems of hidden action and hidden information. We then turn to the more applied question of how to design auctions. We conclude by discussion how one can use mechanisms to make decisions about public projects. The readings for this section consist of a piece by the Eric Maskin who won a Nobel Prize for his work on mechanism design and some slides on auctions by V.S. Subrahmanian. The Maskin article can be tough sledding near the end. Don't worry about necessarily understanding everything. Focus on the big picture that he describes.Maskin: Mechanism DesignV.S. Subrahmanian's auction slidesSection 19: Learning: Replicator DynamicsIn this section, we cover replicator dynamics and Fisher's fundamental theorem. Replicator dynamics have been used to explain learning as well as evolution. Fisher's theorem demonstrates how the rate of adaptation increases with the amount of variation. We conclude by describing how to make sense of both Fisher's theorem and our results on six sigma and variation reduction. The readings for this section are very short. The second reading on Fisher's theorem is rather technical. Both are excerpts from&nbsp;Diversity and ComplexityThe Replicator EquationFisher's TheoremSection 20: The Many Model Thinker: Diversity and PredictionIn our final section, we cover the value of ability and diversity to create wise crowds when making predictions. We start off by talking about category models and linear models and how they can be used to make predictions. We then cover the Diversity Prediction Theorem, which provides basic intuition for how collective prediction works. We conclude by talking about the value of having lots of models. The reading for this section is a short explanation of the diversity prediction theorem.Diversity Prediction TheoremRecommended Background\nStudents should be very comfortable with basic algebra. &nbsp;Calculus isn\u2019t necessary but a conceptual understanding of how derivatives give the slope at a point &nbsp;proves useful.Suggested Readings\nThe Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies (New Edition), Scott E Page. &nbsp;Complex Adaptive Systems: An Introduction to Computational Models of Social Life (Princeton Studies in Complexity), John Miller and Scott Page An Introduction to Models in the Social Sciences, Jean Lave and James MarchCourse Format\nThe class will cover a variety of models. For each model, I will give an introductory lecture accessible to a general audience that last approximately ten minutes. I will follow this with advanced lectures that explain how model's details and how to use it, as well as possible extensions. Many of these more detailed lectures will include integrated questions so you can test your knowledge of the material. I will also offer quizzes separate from the video lectures. I anticipate covering two models per week and recording approximately one hour of video per model.FAQ\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\nNo. I'm working to get all necessary reading material to be available for free on the course web site.\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.\n"}

Participants (who need no prior experience with poetry) will learn how to read poems that are supposedly \"difficult.\" In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the \"experimental mode,\" starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for \"the end of the lecture as we know it\"; instead, the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style\u2014offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.FAQ\nAre there any pre-requisites?\nNo\u2014none at all. You do not need to know anything about poetry (modern or otherwise) to thrive in this course. You need only be willing to spend some extra time with a poem that seems difficult at first.\nAre there going to be days and times when I need to \"attend\" a live session? Do I need to make myself available to participate at certain times of each week?\nNo. Each week you will be reading some poems, viewing approximately 2 hours of videos (discussions of poems), and participating in the discussion forum whenever you have the time - at whatever time of day you prefer. You will have the option of participating in regularly scheduled live webcast sessions, at certain times; these are a great deal of fun but, again, they are optional - and we will immediately provide recordings of the webcasts.\nDo I need to purchase any textbooks for the course?\nNo.\nDo you recommend that I read some poetry in order to prepare for the course?\nNot necessary, but a good idea. Read a few poems by Emily Dickinson and perhaps some of Walt Whitman's \"Song of Myself.\" The works of those two poets are widely available on the web; we will be discussing them in the first week of the course. If you are shopping for books of poetry, we recommend buying a volume of the poems of William Carlos Williams.\nYou say the course is \"fast paced.\" Will it move too fast for me?\nModPo is \"fast paced\" because we will not spend long on any one poet. This is a \"survey\" course\u2014covering many poets with the objective of conveying a sense of poetic movements and trends. We will study only a few poets in any depth (Dickinson, Williams, Gertrude Stein, John Ashbery) but otherwise during each week we will typically talk about poems by three or four or even five different poets.\nHow do the videos fit into the course? What about discussion forums?\nEach filmed/recorded discussion will consist of a close reading of a single poem. To prepare, you will merely need to read (and perhaps re-read) that poem. The process should be straightforward: read the poem, watch the video, then participate in discussion forums, take a short quiz (if assigned) or write a short essay (if assigned). The discussion forums are very important in ModPo\u2014a place to get others' responses to the poems and to ask questions about concepts you don't understand. You should plan to participate in the discussion forums.\nWill there be quizzes as there are in other online courses? Does that make sense in a humanities course?\nThere will be quizzes, yes, but the goal of these is not to ascertain correctness or incorrectness\u2014but to give you a sense of what ideas you are or are not comprehending from the video discussions, and to underscore which concepts are especially important.\nWill a Statement of Accomplishment or \"certificate\" be awarded at the end of ModPo?\nYes. But please note that thousands have enjoyed ModPo\u2014and being part of the ModPo community\u2014without taking the certificate. The requirements for receiving a certificate of completion include: submit four essays; write and submit at least 16 peer reviews of others' essays; take all quizzes (2 per week) and receive scores of higher than 0.0 on all of them; participate at least once weekly in the poem-specific discussion forums.

Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures\nhave invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home\nfor human beings through the development of culture (and technology).\nThroughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated\ncounter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster \u2013 destructive\nof both art and of the world.\nThe\nWestern idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of\nmodernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism\nin relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic\nconsiderations of modernism.\nThis course covers a lot of ground,\nhistorically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very\ndifferent kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry.\nNot all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you\nshould have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. Students\nshould develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some\nof the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to\nread classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence.\nThey should see why these texts are \u201cgood to think with,\u201d and, it is hoped,\nthey will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the\ncourse.\nSyllabus\nWeek I:Why is philosophy relevant to modernity?

{"lang": "en", "name": "The Modern World: Global History since 1760", "cat": "9/humanities", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 332, "desc": "This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective. It begins with the revolutions of the late 1700s, tracks the transformation of the world during the 1800s, and analyzes the cataclysms of last century, concluding with the new phase of world history we are experiencing today. This is a survey course in modern world history for\nstudents, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the world\ngot to be the way it is today. In order to understand modern history, a global\nperspective is essential. This is true whether you are interested in economics,\nwarfare, philosophy, politics, or even pop culture. This course can therefore\nbe essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for\nlifelong learning.\u00a0 In its current form, this course on Coursera is not offered\nfor college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this\ntopic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of\n2014. Both the Coursera and the UVA students use the same online material as\na common foundation for their different learning experiences.\u00a0 This is the material to survey 'what\nhappened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes \u2013 some of\nthose questions that start with:\u00a0\n\"Why?\"\u00a0 (The students in\nthe UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional\nreading; research projects on the histories of particular communities around\nthe world; in-person tutorials and discussions, both with the professor and with the graduate teaching assistants; and examinations.) It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the\nbig patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In this\ncourse, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some\ncareful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big\nchanges come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into\njust a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing\nafter another. So beyond just offering a set of remarkable stories, this course offers you training in how to\nanalyze a situation and\u00a0how to think about problems of explaining change.Syllabus\nIn the outline that follows, the chronological periods being\ncovered are approximate:\nWeek One: From the Traditional to the Modern:&nbsp;Commercial\nand Military Revolutions (1760-1800)\nWeek Two: Democratic Revolutions of the Atlantic World\n(1760-1800)\nWeek Three: Revolutionary Wars (1800-1830)\nWeek Four: The World Transformed (1830-1870)\nWeek Five: The Rise of National Industrial States\n(1830-1871)\nWeek Six: The Rise of National Industrial Empires\n(1871-1900)\nWeek Seven: The Great Acceleration (1890-1910)\nWeek Eight: Crackup (1905-1917)\nWeek Nine: New Orders Emerge (1917-1930)\nWeek Ten: The Crisis of the World (1930-1940)\nWeek Eleven: Total War and Aftermath (1940-1950)\nWeek Twelve: The Return of Wartime (1950-1968)\nWeek Thirteen: Decay and Renaissance (1969-1991)\nWeek Fourteen: The Next Phase (1991-2013) &nbsp;Recommended Background\nNo background is required. All that is needed is an interest in historical exploration.Suggested Readings\nCoursera students are not required to purchase any book. I suggest, however, that you purchase the following textbook: \u00a0Peter von Sivers, Charles Desnoyers, & George Stow, Patterns of World History: Since 1750 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012).\u00a0This book is available in print and as an e-book. Notice that the\n\"Since 1750\" volume is what is being recommended -- the\ntextbook has versions covering earlier periods, so be sure to purchase the one\nfor the modern era. And if you prefer not to buy the book, or it is not\navailable for sale in your country (because of copyright or other problems),\nyou can still take and successfully complete this course.Other relevant readings (articles, book excerpts, etc.) may be posted for download throughout the course, depending on their availability.\u00a0Course Format\nEach week has two to three hours of video presentations organized around a theme and covering a defined period of history. There are five to nine of these relatively short presentations a week, each devoted to a particular topic within that week's theme. Video presentations are accompanied by in-video quiz questions and optional reading assignments to reinforce your grasp on the factual material being covered and some of the interpretive problems. There are also twenty-question weekly quizzes, based only on each week's video presentations; these weekly quizzes are the only graded component of the course.FAQ\nWill I get a\u00a0Statement of Accomplishment for\u00a0completing this course?Yes, further details and requirements\u00a0will be provided once the course begins.\u00a0"}

You will learn the theory behind methods for building and analyzing phylogenetic trees, and get hands-on experience with some widely used software packages. This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.\u00a0A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (e.g., neighbor joining).\u00a0Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are \u00a0investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree will be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.\u00a0Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).Topics covered:Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.Mechanisms of molecular evolution.Models of substitution.Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian statistics).Syllabus\nModule 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to evolutionary theory and&nbsp;population genetics: models of growth, selection and mutationModule&nbsp;2:&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutral mutations and genetic drift.

Likelihood methodsModule&nbsp;5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayesian inference of phylogenyModule&nbsp;6: &nbsp;&nbsp;Testing hypotheses in a phylogenetic contextRecommended Background\nBasic molecular biology (important)Basic bioinformatics (semi important - student should understand the concept of a biological sequence, know what an alignment is and how to construct it, and how to search sequence databases)Basic mathematics (less important, but student should not be afraid of math - the course has been designed to be accessible also for biology students)Knowledge of UNIX is not required but will be helpful\u00a0(exercise manuals will introduce the subject gradually, and we will provide links to self-help resources)Suggested Readings\nInferring Phylogenies by Joseph Felsenstein,\nSinauer Associates, IncCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lectures, quizzes, quizzes and computer exercises. The quizzes are used both to test student knowledge and as a pedagogical tool for putting focus on key aspects of the theory.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Economics of Money and Banking, Part One", "cat": "6/economics_finance", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 334, "desc": "Introduction to a \u201cmoney view\u201d of economic activity for modern times, building on the intellectual traditions of British central banking and American institutionalism. Part One explores the economics of payment systems and money markets. Part Two explores connections with foreign exchange and capital markets. The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.Three features of the new system are central.Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse. \u00a0Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective. \u00a0Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.\u00a0Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.Syllabus\nIntroduction\u00a0 1: \u00a0The Four Prices of Money\u00a0 2: \u00a0The Natural Hierarchy of Money\u00a0 3: \u00a0Money and the State: \u00a0Domestic\u00a0 4: \u00a0The Money View, Macro and MicroBanking as a Clearing System\u00a0 5: \u00a0The Central Bank as a Clearinghouse\u00a0 6: \u00a0Federal Funds, Final Settlement\u00a0 7: \u00a0Repos, Postponing Settlement\u00a0 8: \u00a0Eurodollars, Parallel SettlementBanking as Market Making\u00a0 9: \u00a0The World that Bagehot Knew\u00a0 10: \u00a0Dealers and Liquid Security Markets\u00a0 11: \u00a0Banks and the Market for Liquidity\u00a0 12: \u00a0Lender/Dealer of Last ResortRecommended Background\nThe Barnard version of this course requires Intermediate Microeconomics and Intermediate Macroeconomics as prerequisites for economics majors, but non-economics majors (such as engineers and historians) without those prerequisites have taken the course and done fine. The important thing is some familiarity with economic reasoning and concepts and perhaps some familiarity with the subject matter (such as through job experience or an internship). \u00a0Suggested Readings\nThe lectures are meant to be complete in themselves, and there is no assigned textbook for the course. Weekly readings by a variety of different authors will be posted to introduce students to the range of discourse on money. Students may wish to purchase\nmy book The New Lombard Street, How the Fed Became the Dealer of Last Resort (Princeton 2011), which is also meant to be complete in itself, as a backstop for the videos.Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, shot live in the classroom but then edited down into digestible segments, with integrated quiz questions and animated slide videos added. There will also be weekly quizzes and a final exam.FAQ\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\u00a0You will learn to read, understand, and evaluate professional discourse about the current operation of money markets at the level of the Financial Times.\u00a0\u00a0"}

Where does our sense of right and wrong come from? Why do people so often disagree about moral issues? This course explores the psychological foundations of our moral lives.

How do we make sense of people\u2019s strongly-held opinions\nabout abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action, and torture? How do\nevolution, culture, and religion conspire to shape our moral natures?\nThese are among the most important\u2014and most exciting\u2014questions\naround, and they are the focus of this course. We will explore the modern\nscience of moral belief and moral action, drawing upon disciplines such as\ncognitive science, neuroscience, economics, and philosophy. We will look at\nresearch from the lab, from the community, and from the battlefield; we will\ndiscuss babies, monkeys, and psychopaths; we will debate claims about moral\ndifferences between men and women, liberals and conservatives, Christians and\nMuslims. This course will cover prejudice and bigotry, sexuality and purity; punishment,\nrevenge, and forgiveness; and much much more.&nbsp;\nAs a preview, we have uploaded the introductory lecture to YouTube, which you can view here: http://youtu.be/1jUd72Dmd_ASyllabus\nWeek 1: The Big QuestionsWhat\nis morality, anyway? What are the big debates in the field of moral psychology?\nWeek 2: Compassion Where does concern for others come from? How is it related to empathy\u2014and is more empathy necessarily a good thing? And what can we learn from the study of those who seemingly lack normal moral feelings, such as violent psychopaths?\nWeek 3: Origins of Morality Here, we ask about which aspects of morality are universal. We discuss evolution, cross-cultural research, and the fascinating new science of the moral life of babies.Week 4: Differences&nbsp;How does culture influence our moral thought and moral action? What role does religion play? Why are some of us conservative and others liberal, and how do political differences influence our sense of right and wrong?\nWeek 5: Family, friends, and strangers Our moral feelings are usually most powerful towards our kin (such as our parents and our children) and our friends and allies. We will discuss these special bonds, and then turn to the morality of racial and ethnic bias. Then we use the tools of behavioral economics to explore the controversial question of whether we are ever truly altruistic to strangers.\nWeek 6: The Big Answers&nbsp; We\u2019ll discuss some clever studies that show how our moral behavior is powerfully influenced\u2014often at the unconscious level\u2014by the situations that we find ourselves in. Such findings raise some hard problems about determinism, free will, and moral responsibility. Most of all, if our actions are determined by our brains, our genes, and our situations, in what sense can we be said to be moral agents? The course will end by trying to address this question.&nbsp;Suggested Readings\nMy new book on morality\u2014Just Babies: The Origins\nof Good and Evil\u2014is now available. This is highly recommended for the course. (Purchase book from Amazon | Barnes &amp; Noble). Other readings, as well as links to certain video lectures and TED talks, will be available for free on the course website.&nbsp;FAQ\n1. Do I need any special background to take this course?\nNo. If you can read a popular science book, or an article in a magazine such as The Atlantic or The New Yorker, you should be able to follow the lectures and readings.\n2. Is this course for the faint of heart?\nIt is not. We will examine, from an objective and scientific perspective, some beliefs that many of us hold sacred. We will discuss religion, politics, and sex\u2014sometimes all at the same time. If this idea is disturbing, this might not be the course for\nyou.&nbsp;\n3. Is this a psychology course?\nSort of. I am a psychologist and the questions that we\u2019ll be dealing with, concerning how people behave and how people think, are fundamentally psychological questions. And so we\u2019ll be talking a lot about research and theory from psychology. At the same\ntime, though, other disciplines have a lot of say about our moral lives, and so we\u2019ll also be discussing work by philosophers, economics, neuroscientists and other scholars.&nbsp;\n4. I don\u2019t want to wait until October 7. Is there anything I can do\nto start right away?\nYes!

The understanding provided in this course is essential not only for device modelers, but also for designers of high-performance circuits. The MOS transistor (MOSFET) is the workhorse of the microelectronic revolution. It is&nbsp;estimated that there are currently over&nbsp;1 billion transistors per human being in the world. Part of the MOS transistor's success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within the width of a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this device&nbsp;can do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to do&nbsp;justice to this device.&nbsp;If you want to really know how the MOSFET&nbsp;operates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that.&nbsp;\nThe course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation,&nbsp;noise, and structural effects.

There will be a midterm exam and a&nbsp;final exam.FAQ\nWill I benefit from this course if I am an integrated&nbsp;circuit designer?If you are designing analog or&nbsp;high-performance digital and mixed-signal&nbsp;circuits, the answer is certainly yes. The modern MOSFET is a device with complex and idiosyncratic behavior; you cannot treat it as a black box and hope to develop efficient, high-performance circuits with it. It is no longer sufficient to treat it as a textbook \"square-law device\"; modern devices are not square-law. It is no longer sufficient to think that&nbsp;the device is off if its gate voltage is below the threshold; your watch contains many transistors operating with their gate voltage below the threshold, and they are certainly not off! To design high-caliber circuits, you need a high-caliber understanding of your transistors.What computing resources are&nbsp;required for this course?All you need is a math package, such as Matlab, MathCad, Mathematica, or any other package that can help you quickly evaluate algebraic expressions and make plots. Such packages often have inexpensive student versions available. There is also math freeware, such as GNU Octave,&nbsp;available on the Web.&nbsp;How easy is it to get by in this course&nbsp;without reading the textbook?Some students&nbsp;could get by without it, depending on their background and their learning style; but reading the textbook will really help. The textbook provides detailed explanations for everything we cover in the lectures, including parts &nbsp;which, due to lack of time, are just mentioned&nbsp;and taken&nbsp;for granted. At Columbia, students taking a similar course spend about half of their time reading the textbook, and half doing the homework.Do I need a background in semiconductor devices?&nbsp;You do not need a background beyond what is provided in many basic electronics courses, concerning electrons and holes, intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, drift and diffusion, etc. However, even these concepts will be reviewed at the beginning of the course. If you have not seen such material before, this review, together with reading the first chapter of the textbook, should be enough to allow you to&nbsp;follow the rest of the course."}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Introduction to Music Production", "cat": "1/arts_music_film", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 339, "desc": "Learn about the music production process\u2014including recording, editing, and mixing\u2014and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.&nbsp; Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),&nbsp; a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board\u2014a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.Syllabus\nLesson 1: Sound and Signal Flow\nPropagation, Amplitude, Frequency, Visualizing Sound, Connections Overview, Microphone as a Transducer, Microphone Types, Microphone Frequency Response, Microphone Polar Patterns, Microphone Placement, Line Level and Gain Staging, Cables, Interface, MIcrophone Connection and Gain, Analog to Digital Converter, Pickup Connections, The Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) Lesson 2: The DAW\nAnalog to Digital Conversion, Buffer Size, File Types, Project Folder, Project Checklist, Multitrack, Recording Audio, Trimming, Separating and Cutting, The Grid, Fades, Zooming, Cycling, Merging, Naming and Coloring, Markers, Comping, Software Instruments, MIDI Editing: Velocity, MIDI Editing: Quantization, Common MIDI Recording and Editing Functions Lesson 3: The Mixer\nThe Channel Strip, The Bus Concept, Effects Categories, Inserts, The Submix, Sends, Automation Lesson 4: Dynamic Effects\nNoise, Distortion, Dynamic Range Manipulation, Dynamic Processors Overview, Dynamic Processor Parameters, Gate, Downward Compressor, Limiter Lesson 5: Filter and Delay Effects The Delay Concept, The Delay Spectrum, Modulated Short Delays, Filters Overview, Mixing EQ, Medium Delay: Slap Back, Long Delay, Reverb, Width in Mixing, Space in Mixing Lesson 6: Synthesis\nOscillators, Filters, Amplifiers, LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator), A Language of Timbre Recommended Background\nYou should be able to perform the following tasks in a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), such as GarageBand, Pro Tools, Logic, Live, Reason, SONAR, or Digital Performer: Create audio tracksAdd audio effects (EQ, Noise Gate, Compressor, Delay, and Reverb)Create MIDI tracksAdd a software synthesizer to a MIDI trackExport an audio fileCreate an MP3 fileSuggested Readings\nComposing and Producing Electronic Music by Loudon StearnsCourse Format\nThe course consists of video demonstrations, with integrated quizzes that allow you to reinforce your knowledge of the material before moving on.

Since 2009 there has been a renewed wave of\npopular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but\ngenerally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or\nbeen swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not\nfared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social\ndecline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are\nbeing challenged, often very violently. This course is a survey of the\nconstitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th\ncentury throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on\nthe actors that have dominated this\ndiscourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical\nwritings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand\nthe contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political\ndevelopments of the 20th and 21st centuries.Three common themes will characterise the course:\u00a0We privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional.\u00a0We seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood.\u00a0We seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity.\u00a0Ultimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Presenting the Course (Overview)1.1 Welcome and Introduction1.2 Presenting the Region1.3 Early Modern History1.4 Unresolved Challenge of Modernity1.5 Four Models of Adaptation1.6 Indicators of Relative Failure1.7 Role of Religion and Islamic LawWeek 2: Ottoman Empire & Modern Turkey2.1 People, Place and Patterns2.2 Ottoman History2.3 Ottoman Reform: Tanzimat and Majallah2.4 Creation of the Republic2.5 Kemalism & Its Problems2.6 Westernisation and Islamism\u00a0Week 3: Egypt & Maghreb3.1 People, Place & Patterns: Egypt3.2 People, Place & Patterns: Maghreb3.3 Ottoman & Colonial History3.4 Independence3.5 Modernisation & Reform3.6 Nasserism & Its Problems3.7 Westernisation & IslamismWeek 4: Saudi Arabia & The Gulf4.1 People, Place & Patterns\u00a04.2 Ottoman & Colonial History4.3 Patrimonialism & Religion4.4 Rentier Economies\u00a04.5 Impact of Rents4.6 Paradoxical Alliance4.7 Unresolved ContradictionsWeek 5 Iran & The Shiites5.1 People, Place & Patterns5.2 Imperial & Colonial History5.3 Constitutional Revolution & Reaction5.4 Nationalist Revolution & Reaction5.5 Islamic Revolution & Reaction5.6 Khomeini\u2019s Theory of Velayat-e Faqih5.7 Unresolved ContradictionsWeek 6 The Levant (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon & Iraq)6.1 Taking Stock & Midway Summary6.2 People, Place & Patterns6.3 French Mandates6.4 British Mandates\u00a06.5 Order & Fractured Societies6.6 Failure of Arab Socialism6.7 Unresolved ContradictionsWeek 7: Afghanistan, Pakistan & Bangladesh7.1 People, Place & Patterns7.2 Colonial History of British India7.3 Post-Independence: Pakistan and Bangladesh7.4 Afghanistan: Creation of the State and its \u2018Golden Years\u20197.5\u00a0Afghanistan: Social Engineering and Resistance7.6 Failure of State-Building and Islamisation: Jihadi Gangsters7.7 Unresolved ContradictionsWeek 8 Malaysia & Indonesia8.1 People, Place & Patterns8.2 Colonial History Malaysia8.3 Colonial History Indonesia8.4 Post-Independence Malaysia8.5 Post-Independence Indonesia8.6 Unresolved ContradictionsWeek 9 Sub-Saharan Africa9.1 People, Place, Patterns9.2 Colonial History Muslim Africa9.3 Neo-Colonial Legacies9.4 Weak States & Institutions9.5 Post-Independence Instability\u00a09.6 Fractured Constitutional BargainsWeek 10 Conclusion & Outlook10.1 Commonality & Diversity10.2 Unity & Friction10.3 Minorities10.4 Legal & Social Reality10.5 Practical Tensions10.6 Popular Dissatisfaction10.7 Good ByeRecommended Background\nBy choice and necessity, this course will\nbe interdisciplinary and has no prerequisites.

We shall focus on two topics with wider cultural implications \u2013 the soul and the heart. In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism has become more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested in mysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern mysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with exploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts in the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending with contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that the European mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of psychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its own terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also in general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than a physical center!...) and the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny and asking if there were influences and meetings between the different religions.Syllabus\nLecture 1: IntroductionMysticism: Various Approaches.

Lectures are divided into several 5-15 minute segments. Occasionally there will be in-class learning reinforcement exercises (These will not be calculated into the final grade of the course).Each lecture will be followed by a homework assignment which will consist of several questions. The answers will be peer-graded by other students in the course; from our experience, this method is one of the best ways to ensure that students think about and \"internalize\" - not just memorize - the material they have learnt. The final grade of the course will be the average of the student's five highest grades (out of seven) on the homework assignments.In this course there is no required reading. A full list of suggested readings will appear on the course session website, for those interested in deepening their understanding.&nbsp;FAQ\nWhat is the coolest thing that I will learn in this\ncourse?\nThat actually twentieth\ncentury psychoanalysis itself may be indebted to religious and mystical ideas. Do you recommend that I read anything in order to prepare\nfor the course?\nIt is a good idea to do\nsome wiki-based research on Mysticism, Kabbalah, and Psychoanalysis - especially as it appears in the thought of Carl Jung and James Hillman. Will I get college credit for this course?Coursera and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem do not provide college credit for this course; however, students who satisfactorily complete the course requirements will receive a certificate of completion."}
{"lang": "en", "name": "Greek and Roman Mythology", "cat": "9/humanities", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 344, "desc": "This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some\nof them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding\nof a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their\nexploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple\ntales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some\ngreat deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem\nto like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece\nand Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it\nplays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention\nto the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.\nAre myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window\non the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders\nthat all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining\nstories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate\nthese questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of\nthe universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,\nreligion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.Syllabus Week 1: Homer, epic poetry, and Trojan legends Week 2: Heroes and suffering Week 3: This World and other ones Week 4: Identity and signs Week 5: Gods and humans Week 6: Religion and ritual Week 7: Justice Week 8: Unstable selves Week 9: Writing myth in history Week 10: From myths to mythology\nRecommended Background\nNo special background is needed other than the willingness and ability\nto synthesize complex texts and theoretical material.

For additional information, you are welcome (but do not require) to refer to:Ji\u0159\u00ed\u00a0Janata,\u00a0Principles of Chemical\nSensors, Springer, 2d Edition (1989).\nRoger George Jackson, Novel Sensors\nand Sensing, CRC Press (2004).Florinel-Gabriel Banica,\u00a0Chemical\nSensors and Biosensors: Fundamentals and Applications, John\nWiley and Sons (2012).\nRamsden\u00a0Jeremy,\u00a0Nanotechnology,\nan Introduction. Elsevier (2011).Course Format\nThis course will have three types of graded\nactivities that will be included in your overall course grade. These include:\nWeekly Quizzes:&nbsp;You will be asked to answer ten weekly quizzes that account for 30% of the course total grade (3 points for each quiz). Each quiz includes 7 to 13 multiple choice questions that examines your understanding of the learning materials. You may take each quiz up to three times, and you will receive credit for the highest of the three scores. The regular Due date for taking a weekly quiz will be 12:00 PM (Pacific Time) on the Monday following that week\u2019s video assignments. For example, Due date for the Week 1 quiz will be the Monday of Week 2. You may take the quiz for one week following this Due date (though still only three times total), but there will be a 10% penalty applied. The purpose of the penalty is to encourage you not to fall too far behind in the assignments.Each Quiz includes three important dates: Opening time, Due date (for full credit), and Hard deadline (10% penalty). The exact dates are posted in the 'Schedule' section. It is important to keep track of these dates.Open-ended Questions:&nbsp;You will be asked to answer two open-ended questions that account for 20% of the course total grade . The questions encourage creative thinking, and their answers are based on the knowledge you gained in the course, as well as, on your own imagination and experience. The questions will be presented in Weeks &nbsp;4 and 7. Providing thorough answers to the open-ended questions will help you generate innovative ideas for your final project. Your&nbsp;will write your answers&nbsp;in a textbox, limited to 500. You can also write your answers on a document and attach it. You are welcome to explain your ideas via drawings, photos, and/or a short video of up to 1.5 minute (as a link). The deadline for submitting your answers will be 12:00 PM (Pacific Time)on Friday , two weeks after the question was first opened. For example, the Week 4 open-ended question will be due on Friday of Week 6. The exact dates for submission will be announced during the course; late submissions will not be counted.Since this is a peer graded task, your answers will be graded by peers, according to a grading rubric.&nbsp;After submitting your own answer, you will be asked to read and grade&nbsp;four&nbsp;&nbsp;answers of your peers.The grading task includes two stages: a. ranking each evaluation category according to the grading rubric, b. providing written comments in the Overall Evaluation textbox. The written comments should include at least 1 paragraph of information for each evaluation category. They should be critical as well as positive. If you give low ratings, you need to explain to your peer how s/he can improve their ideas. It is always good practice to refer to the lecture contents when you are making critical comments.Each open-ended question task includes three important dates: Opening time, Submission deadline, and Evaluation&nbsp;deadline. The exact dates are posted in the 'Schedule' section. It is important to keep track of these dates.Grades for the open-ended questions task will be assigned to you only after you review the work of your peers and submit your comments.s.\nFinal project: At the end of the course you will be asked to\ncomplete a final project. The final project will be conducted in groups of\n3-to4 students. It will consist of a written report that focuses on the\nutilization of nanotechnology and nanosensors to imitate a specific sense that\nrelates to human senses: vision, hearing, taste,\nsmell, or touch. Other non-specific senses such as balance and pains can be\nincluded as well. The final project should include, but not\nconfined to: (a) multidisciplinary presentation and discussion of the\noverall design approach; (b) fabrication; (c) characterization;\nand (d) application of the targeted artificial sense. The report\nshall NOT exceed 10 pages, written in 11-12 font size, 1.5 line spacing, and\n2.5 cm margins from each side of the document. The final project will be graded\nby your peers, according to a grading rubric, accounting for 50% of your\noverall course grade."}

Nanotechnology is an exciting research area that spans disciplines from electrical engineering to biology. &nbsp;Over the last two decades the basic science of this area has launched new technologies, the first examples of which are finding their way into commercial products. &nbsp;This four week course will provide students with a bird's eye view into this fast moving area and leave students with an appreciation of the importance and foundation of super-small materials and devices.Syllabus\nNanotechnology: The BasicsWeek 1: Small, strange and useful! This first week we will introduce nanotechnology.&nbsp; As you will learn, defining the term itself can be a challenge and the discipline has a rich and somewhat controversial history.&nbsp; We will conclude the week with a tour of the different types of materials in the nanotechnology pantheon that sets up the class for the weeks to come.Week 2: Electronics when materials are super small.&nbsp; There is no doubt our lives have been changed by the small and powerful computers we now use in everything from our cell phones to our coffeemakers.&nbsp; This week you will learn how nanotechnology has been a part of this revolution and what the limits are to making wires and transistors super, super small.Week 3: How magnets change when they are made small.&nbsp; Magnetism is quite mysterious and the foundation of such cool technologies as flash drives and MRI imaging.&nbsp; Nanotechnology has played a crucial role in advancing all of these diverse applications and in week 3 you'll gain some insight into how that is possible.Week 4: Shedding light on nanoscale materials and photonics.&nbsp; Compared to electrons, photons are difficult things to trap and control with normal materials.&nbsp; Nanomaterials offer completely new approaches to manipulating light.&nbsp; Whether its through diffraction, or plasmonics, nanotechnology can provide new capabilities for solid state lasers as well as super resolution microscopes.Recommended Background\nWe expect some knowledge of freshman chemistry and physics, as well as algebra.&nbsp; Access to a spreadsheet program would also be of value.&nbsp; However, we recognize that for some interested participants this knowledge may be rusty and will provide where possible optional review videos to go over terminology and concepts relevant to the week's material.Suggested Readings\nWe will refer students to web-based materials where appropriate.&nbsp; There isn't really a standard nanotechnology textbook (yet!).Course Format\nEvery week students will be expected to view between&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;9 video lectures which are about 10 minutes each; optional refresher lectures will sometimes be added to provide background on concepts relevant for the week. Most lectures will have integrated questions to keep students engaged, and these will not count towards any grade. There will also be weekly 'basic'&nbsp;quizzes and a final exam for students seeking a statement of accomplishment.&nbsp; For those seeking a statement of accomplishment with distinction, &nbsp;'in-depth' quizzes and a peer-graded project will be required in addition to the statement of accomplishment criteria.&nbsp; Students will have two weeks to complete every assignment once its posted, and eight late days to apply as needed.FAQ What is the format of the class? This course offers two distinct tracks. To\nreceive a statement of accomplishment, students will complete basic quizzes and\na final exam. For those who wish to receive a receive\na statement of accomplishment with distinction, &nbsp;they will need to complete &nbsp;in-depth quizzes and a peer-graded project &nbsp;in addition to the statement of accomplishment criteria.&nbsp;\nRegardless of track, students are given two\nweeks to complete every assignment after posting.&nbsp; Also the late policy\nprovides students with 8 days to apply as needed. Are there any prerequisites? This course requires that students (a) have ready access to and facility with a spreadsheet program like Excel; (b) have had a freshman level science class and are familiar with&nbsp;college level&nbsp;chemistry and physics. What resources do I need for this class? This course requires that students (a) have ready access to a spreadsheet program like Google Spreadsheet, Excel or Open Office; (b) have had a freshman level science class and have familiarity with advanced high school or college freshman chemistry and physics. Does Rice award credentials or reports regarding my work in this course? Rice University does not issue transcripts&nbsp;but does support&nbsp;certificates of accomplishment associated with classes as described on the&nbsp;course page.&nbsp; Coursera will maintain limited data regarding student progress and performance in this course and, with your permission, provide authorized third parties with access to such data.\n"}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Network Analysis in Systems Biology", "cat": "2/biology_life_sciences|5/computer_science|8/engineering_technology|15/mathematics_statistics_and_data_analysis", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 349, "desc": "An introduction to data integration and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology, Bioinformatics and Systems Pharmacology research. The course Network Analysis in Systems Biology provides an introduction to Big Data analysis in systems biology including statistical methods used to identify differentially expressed genes, performing various types of enrichment analyses, and applying clustering algorithms. You will also learn how to construct, analyze and visualize functional association networks that can be created from many resources, including gene regulatory networks connecting transcription factors to their target genes, protein-protein interaction networks, cell signaling pathways and networks, drug-target and drug-drug similarity networks and other functional association networks. Methods to process raw data from genome-wide mRNA expression (microarrays and RNA-seq) will be presented. Processed data will be clustered, and gene-set enrichment analyses methods will be covered. The course is mostly about practical tutorials for analyzing various high content experimental datasets, but it also contains theoretical discussions about the mathematics behind the methods and tools. The course is mostly appropriate for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates majoring in fields such as biology but also math, physics, chemistry, computer science, biomedical and electrical engineering. The course will be useful for researchers who encounter large datasets in their own research, typically genome-wide. The course will teach how to use existing software tools such as those developed by the&nbsp;Ma\u2019ayan Laboratory at Mount Sinai, but also other freely available tools. In addition, you will have the opportunity to participate in crowdsourcing micro- and mega-task projects. The ultimate aim of the course is to enable you to utilize the methods you learn here for analyzing your own data for your own projects, as well as think about the problems we face in the field of computational systems biology.Syllabus\nModule 1 - Introductions and Course Overview:&nbsp;These first two lectures introduce the&nbsp;Ma'ayan Lab&nbsp;members&nbsp;and then a broad overview about the course is provided by Professor Ma'ayan.Module 2 - Data Processing and Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes:&nbsp;This set of lectures first discuss data normalization methods, and then several lectures are devoted to explaining the problem of identifying differentially expressed genes with the focus on understanding the inner workings of a new method developed by the Ma'ayan Lab called the&nbsp;Characteristic Direction.&nbsp;Module 3 - Gene List Enrichment Analyses:&nbsp;In this module the emphasis is on tools developed by the&nbsp;Ma'ayan Lab&nbsp;to analyze gene sets. Several tools will be discussed including:&nbsp;Enrichr,&nbsp;GEO2Enrichr,&nbsp;Expression2Kinases&nbsp;and&nbsp;DrugPairSeeker. In addition, one lecture will be devoted to a method we call enrichment vector clustering we developed, and two lectures will describe the popular GSEA method.Module 4 - Deep Sequencing Data Analysis:&nbsp;A set of lectures will cover the basic steps and popular pipelines to analyze RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data going from the raw data to gene lists to figures. These lectures also cover UNIX/Linux commands and some programming elements of R, a popular freely available statistical software.Module 5 - PCA, Hierarchical Clustering, Self-Organizing Maps, and Network-based Clustering:&nbsp;This module is devoted to various method of clustering: principle components analysis, self-organizing maps, network-based clustering and hierarchical clustering. The theory behind these methods of analysis are covered in detail, and this is followed by some practical demonstration of the methods for applications using R and MATLAB.Module 6 - Resources for Data Integration:&nbsp;Next are lectures about the various types of networks that are typically constructed and analyzed in systems biology and systems pharmacology. These lectures start with the idea of functional association networks (FANs). Following this lecture are several lectures that discuss how to construct FANs from various resources and how to use these networks for analyzing gene lists as well as to construct a puzzle that can be used to connect genomic data with phenotypic data.Module 7 - Crowdsourcing:&nbsp;The final set of lectures presents the idea of crowsourcing. In Coursera we have the opportunity to work together on projects that are difficult to complete alone (microtasks) or compete by thinking and implementing algorithms for solving hard problems (megatasks). You will have the opportunity to participate in three crowdsourcing projects: one microtask and two megatasks.

How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors? We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions. Social networks pervade our social and economic lives. \u00a0 They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally. \u00a0 The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. \u00a0This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.The course begins with some empirical background on\u00a0social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to\u00a0describe and measure networks. \u00a0 Next, we will cover a set of\u00a0models of how networks form, including random network models as well as\u00a0strategic formation models, and some hybrids. \u00a0 We will then discuss a series of\u00a0models of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.Syllabus\nWeek 1:\u00a0Introduction, Empirical Background and DefinitionsExamples of Social Networks and their Impact, Definitions, Measures and Properties: Degrees, Diameters, Small Worlds, Weak and Strong Ties, Degree DistributionsWeek 2: Background, Definitions, and Measures\u00a0ContinuedHomophily, Dynamics, \u00a0Centrality Measures: Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Eigenvector, and Katz-Bonacich.\u00a0Erdos and Renyi Random Networks:\u00a0Thresholds and Phase Transitions,Week 3:\u00a0Random Networks\u00a0Poisson Random Networks, Exponential Random Graph Models, \u000f Growing Random Networks, Preferential Attachment and Power Laws, Hybrid models of Network FormationWeek 4: \u00a0\u000f Strategic Network Formation\u00a0Game Theoretic Modeling of Network Formation, The Connections Model, The Conflict between Incentives and E\u000efficiency, Dynamics, Directed Networks, Hybrid Models of Choice and ChanceWeek 5:\u00a0\u00a0Di\u000bffusion on Networks.\u00a0Empirical Background, The Bass Model,\u00a0Random Network Models of Contagion, The SIS model, Fitting a Simulated Model to DataWeek 6:\u00a0\u00a0Learning on Networks.\u00a0Bayesian Learning on Networks, The DeGroot Model of\u00a0Learning on a Network, Convergence of Beliefs, The Wisdom of Crowds, How Influence depends on Network Position.Week 7:\u00a0Games on Networks.\u00a0Network Games, Peer Influences: \u00a0Strategic\u00a0Complements and Substitutes, the Relation between Network Structure and Behavior, A Linear Quadratic Game,\u00a0Repeated Interactions and Network Structures.Recommended Background\nThe course has some basic prerequisites in mathematics and statistics. \u00a0For example, it will be assumed that students are comfortable with basic concepts from linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplication), probability theory (e.g., probability distributions, expected values, Bayes' rule), and statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing), and some light calculus (e.g., differentiation and integration). \u00a0Beyond those concepts, the course will be self-contained.Suggested Readings\nThe course is self-contained, so that all the definitions and concepts you need to solve the problem sets and final are contained in the video lectures. &nbsp;Much of the material for the course is covered in a text: Matthew O.

Topics will include the implications of new knowledge of the brain for our understanding of selfhood, for the meaning of privacy, for the distinction between therapy and enhancement, and for national security. \u201cPerhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.\u201d --George Orwell Neuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that \u201c(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.\u201d This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.

Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of \u201cWho Gets What\u201d and covers sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change. Part 2 turns to the related issue of \u201cWho Survives\u201d and includes studies of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development, human development and social organization, and social organization and social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation and presents studies of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism from late imperial times to the present-day.\nOur class eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on how these new facts complicate our understanding of comparative societies, human behavior, and the construction of individual and group identities. That being said, while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late imperial, early modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss change over time as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history to the shared stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and collectivization, and reform and globalization.Syllabus\nPart 1 will cover the following subjects: Social Structure and Education in Late Imperial China Education and Social Mobility in Contemporary China Social Mobility and Wealth Distribution in China Wealth Distribution and Regime Change\nRecommended Background\nNo requirements.

Or a system that can understand natural language instructions from a human? This class will cover the fundamentals of mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.\nIn this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.Syllabus\nTopics covered include:\n1. Language modeling.\n2.

The course will also touch on contemporary issues regarding nuclear power generation including: the nuclear fuel cycle, the economics of nuclear power, and nuclear non-proliferation. The course, \u201cA Look at Nuclear Science and Technology\u201d is aimed at scientifically inclined individuals who want to learn more about nuclear energy and the nuclear power industry. It will address subjects such as: What is nuclear energy? What is its history? Who are its heroes? Why is it controversial? How do nuclear power plants work? What about nuclear weapons? What are the stereotypes and misconceptions? We expect many students who finish this class to want to go on for further study in a closely related field.Syllabus\n\u201cA Look at Nuclear Science and Technology\u201d is an overview course that provides broad subject-area coverage to introduce students to application of theory to practical aspects of nuclear science and technology in the world today with special emphasis on commercial nuclear power. The course will begin with a general overview of nuclear physics and the practical applications covered by the field of nuclear engineering. The majority of the course will focus on the theory, design and operation of commercial nuclear power reactors. The course will also touch on contemporary issues regarding nuclear power generation including: the nuclear fuel cycle, the economics of nuclear power, and nuclear non-proliferation.The course will begin with a grand tour of the commercial nuclear fuel cycle and power reactors so the student will have some perspective before delving into the theory that is important to understanding the unique aspects of nuclear energy. The course then will return to the fundamentals of basic nuclear physics, reactor physics, energy removal and power conversion to prepare students for in-depth looks at the theory and function of commercial nuclear power reactors.This course is intended for students who have had little to no academic instruction in nuclear engineering. Some of my incentives to teach this class are (1) to stimulate interest and excitement about nuclear science and technology, and (2) to create a more informed citizenry on the subject of nuclear energy utilization in the future.

Simple, first order ordinary differential equations will be used now and then.Suggested Readings\nNuclear Engineering \u2013 Theory and Technology of Commercial Nuclear Power by Ronald Allen Knief, 2nd Edition, Taylor & Francis, 1992Additional readings to be providedCourse Format\nThis\nclass will consist of lecture videos, which are between\u00a010 and\u00a020\nminutes in length, and brief PowerPoint slides, accompanied by narration.\nUngraded quiz questions will be provided for each lecture. The overall grade\nfor the course will be based on the student\u2019s performance on a weekly exam.FAQ\nAlthough I have a college degree, I don\u2019t have a very strong background in science. Do you think I have a chance at succeeding in this class? Yes. I\u2019ve structured it with you in mind.\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class? Students who successfully complete this class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nWhat resources will I need for this class? You will need a computer that can access high speed Internet. While it will help to have a copy of the text by Knief (see recommended text listed above), the course materials are mostly self-contained and reading materials can be accessed on the Web or available from within the course.\nWhat are the coolest things I\u2019ll learn if I take this class? You will learn that a tiny fuel pellet less than 0.2 cubic inches will provide the energy equivalent of approximately 2,000 pounds of coal. There will be no CO2 emission from reactor operation and the volume of waste produced will be on the order of the volume of the fuel pellet. You will learn what the real danger of radiation is. You will examine myths and misconceptions about splitting the atom to make energy. You will learn that the old alchemist's dream of transferring one element into another is possible with nuclear transmutations.\nWhat is the format of the class? The course will be essentially recorded lectures of 10 to 30 minutes with assessment material at the end of each segment. You should expect to spend 4 to 6 hours per week viewing the material, doing extra readings, participating in discussions with fellow students and taking the assessments.\nWhat about timing?\u00a0 Can I take this self-paced? Probably not. There will be due dates for each assessment to keep us moving forward together. So you won\u2019t be able to wait until the last week and do all the material in a day or two. We expect that you will be committed to work on the course each week as you would for any other college class.\nCan we contact the professor? The professor will be nearby and monitoring the course. If problems come up, he will address them in the Announcement section or in the discussion forum. The discussion forum is an important part of the course and much of the learning happens when you interact with other students, so I encourage you to do that.\nCopyright\n\u00a92013 University of Pittsburgh"}

We will look at the diet-related risk factors in cancer development as well as evidence-based guidelines for the nutritional management of cancer and treatment-related side effects. Additional emphasis is placed on emerging cancer nutrition research and debunking diet and cancer myths.\n\u00a0\nModule 5: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Obesity and Weight Management\n\u00a0\nGlobal statistics for obesity did not exist 50 years ago. Now, you can\u2019t turn around without exploding obesity statistics smacking you in the face! We will explore the complex and interrelated factors that contribute to rising obesity rates, discuss various approaches to weight loss and weight maintenance and strategize for future solutions to this global epidemic.\n\u00a0\nModule 6: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Disorders of the GI Tract\n\u00a0\nA healthy digestive tract is crucial for optimal nutrition status. Impairments in any segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can quickly undermine proper nutrient digestion, absorption and utilization. In this module we will look at how a healthy gut should work, and what to do when the digestive process is disrupted. Specific GI focus areas include celiac disease and gluten free foods, diverticular disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, dysphagia, gas, constipation and malabsorptive disorders and look at the roles of dietary fiber and probiotics and prebiotics in gut health.Recommended Background\nBasic understanding of nutrition science: macronutrients, micronutrients\nand digestion.Course Format\nThe course is divided into six modules, each covering a distinct area\nof nutrition science or disease state.

Over 65 percent of adults and over 30 percent of children meet the classification\nof being overweight or obese, and with this excess weight comes numerous\nhealth conditions that include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal\ndisorders, and even impairments in cognitive function. Because in most\ncases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a\npoor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no\nsurprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition\nand sufficient physical activity is imperative.\nThis course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge\nto develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added\na foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These\ntwo key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella\nof calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories\nthat we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life\nand to perform all of our daily tasks and functions.\nUltimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand\nhow to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when\nthey are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key\nissues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting\nand maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption\nand maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.\nSyllabus\nThere are no required textbooks for this course.

You will learn how to improve productivity, how to provide more choice to customers, how to reduce response times, and how to improve quality. PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES&nbsp;\nRemember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and didn\u2019t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor\u2019s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn\u2019t want to pay too much for it. Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity, increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations, Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.\nWatch this video to learn more about the Wharton Foundation Series on Coursera:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgS3AJCe6i8\nClick below for the other Wharton Foundation Series courses:\nAn Introduction to Marketing\nAn Introduction to Corporate Finance An Introduction to Financial AccountingSyllabus\nThe course is broken up into six modules: Introduction Process analysis Productivity Responsiveness Quality Product variety\nThere are two tracks in this course, an academic track and a practitioner track. For the academic track, the final grade is determined based on five homework assignments and a final exam.&nbsp;It is also possible to complete the course via\na practitioner track, which requires the completion of a real world application project.\nRecommended Background\nThe course is designed for business school students and executives. There are no academic prerequisites for the course; this is not a math course and nothing done in this course requires more than high school math.\n&nbsp;\nThis course will be helpful to students that: are preparing for their career in business and want to lay some foundations are in the middle of their career and have some real problems to solve right now Suggested Readings\nAlthough the class is designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in this one-quarter class or who want more practice problems, more in-depth explanations, or more math should look at the following book:&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Cachon, Gerard, Christian Terwiesch, Matching Supply with Demand: An Introduction to Operations Management , 3rd edition, Irwin - McGraw Hill, 2012 (ISBN 978-0073525204, 507 pages)Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are between&nbsp;7 and 12 minutes in length. Many of them contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures. The course ends with\na final exam. For the practitioner track, students need to complete a course project along the way which, in each week,&nbsp;applies the learnings from the modules to a real world problem.&nbsp;FAQ Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? Contingent on academic performance, you will get a Statement of Accomplishment stating that you completed this course. However, no certificate will be given from Wharton / Penn and successful completion of this course does not make you a Wharton / Penn alumnus. What resources will I need for this class? You will need access to a spreadsheet program, some paper, and a pencil. Nothing more. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? You will look at the world with different eyes - you will start to detect bottlenecks, identify productivity wastes, and come up with ideas to improve business processes. A known side effect of these skills is that you might drive friends, family, or co-workers crazy when you point to their improvement opportunities... What does a typical class look like? In a typical video session, I will introduce a small case to outline a problem in an operation. That could be a hospital, a restaurant, a bank, a call center, or whatever other setting. We will then use the setting of the case to discuss various performance measures as well as what one might want to do to improve the operation. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For more information on Penn\u2019s Open Learning initiative, please go to:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://openlearning.upenn.edu\n"}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Probabilistic Graphical Models", "cat": "5/computer_science", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 378, "desc": "In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques. What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?\nUncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.Syllabus\nTopics covered include:\nThe Bayesian network and Markov network representation, including extensions for reasoning over domains that change over time and over domains with a variable number of entities\nReasoning and inference methods, including exact inference (variable elimination, clique trees) and approximate inference (belief propagation message passing, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods)\nLearning parameters and structure in PGMs\nUsing a PGM for decision making under uncertainty.\nThere will be short weekly review quizzes and programming assignments (Octave/Matlab) focusing on case studies and applications of PGMs to real-world problems:\nCredit Scoring and Factors\nModeling Genetic Inheritance and Disease\nMarkov Networks and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\nInference: Belief Propagation\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo and Image Segmentation\nDecision Theory:&nbsp;Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia\nConditional Random Field Learning for OCR\nStructure Learning for Identifying Skeleton Structure\nHuman Action Recognition with Kinect\nTo prepare for the class in advance, you may consider reading through the following sections of the&nbsp;textbook (discount code DKPGM12)&nbsp;by Daphne and Nir Friedman:\nIntroduction and Overview.&nbsp;Chapters 1, 2.1.1 - 2.1.4, 4.2.1.\nBayesian Network Fundamentals.&nbsp;Chapters 3.1 - 3.3.\nMarkov Network Fundamentals.&nbsp;Chapters 4.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.4, 4.6.1.\nStructured CPDs.&nbsp;Chapters 5.1 - 5.5.\nTemplate Models.&nbsp;Chapters 6.1 - 6.4.1.\nThese will be covered in the first two weeks of the online class.\nThe slides for the whole class can be found&nbsp;here.\nFAQ\nWill I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nWhat are the pre-requisites for the class?\nYou should be able to program in at least one programming language and have a computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) with internet access (programming assignments will be conducted in Matlab or Octave). It also helps to have some previous exposure to basic concepts in discrete probability theory (independence, conditional independence, and Bayes' rule).\nWhat textbook should I buy?\nAlthough the lectures are designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in a one-quarter class can find a much more extensive coverage of this topic in the book \"Probabilistic Graphical Models\", by Koller and Friedman, published by MIT Press. MIT Press has generously provided a&nbsp;discount code (DKPGM12)&nbsp;&nbsp;for students enrolled in this course.\nHow difficult is the class?\nThis class does require some abstract thinking and mathematical skills. However, it is designed to require fairly little background, and a motivated student can pick up the background material as the concepts are introduced.

Other course elements (lecture videos with \u201cclicker\u201d questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.Participants who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.&nbsp;Syllabus\n(NB:&nbsp; This syllabus will be revised soon to reflect a 16-week term; please check back later.&nbsp; ) Week 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion in 1D: Kinematics, Vectors (Part 1) &amp; Newton\u2019s 2nd Law\nLab 0:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install Video Analysis &amp; Computer Modeling Software\nWeek 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Motion in 1D: Prediction of Motion; Constant/Non-Constant Forces\nLab 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constant Velocity Motion in Your Surroundings\nWeek 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion in &gt; 1D: Vectors (Part 2) &amp; Newton\u2019s 2nd Law\nWeek 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Motion in &gt; 1D: Prediction of Motion; Momentum\nLab 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free Fallin\u2019 with Drag (1D Dynamics)\nWeek 5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curving Motion, Including Uniform/Non-Uniform Circular Motion\nWeek 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy Principle; Work\nLab 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Galactic Black Holes (&gt;1D Dynamics)\nWeek 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiparticle Systems: Potential Energy\nWeek 8: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy Applications\nLab 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rope Physics in Sports (Forces &amp; Energy)\nWeek 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy &amp; Momentum: Collisions\nWeek 10: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angular Momentum Principle\nLab 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free Choice Project (Energy &amp; Momentum)\nWeek 11: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nFinal Exam; Lab 5 Submit &amp; Evaluate\nRecommended Background\nNo background with computer programming is required.\nParticipants with nothing more than some experience in basic algebra (and\na sense of adventure!) will be able to participate in at least some of\nthe labs and other course work.\nParticipants with good algebra and trigonometry skills but no background\nin calculus will be able to participate almost all labs and most other\ncourse work.\nThose who have some familiarity with calculus will be able to participate\nin all aspects of the course.\nSuggested Readings\nSuggested reading assignments will be drawn from the textbook,&nbsp;Matter and Interactions: Volume 1 Modern Mechanics,\n3rd edition, (R.

Fundamental principles will be applied to construct\nmodels (including computer models) of the observed motion. Every student\nwill record a video lab report comparing these observations and submit\nit for peer review.&nbsp; Course participants will evaluate the video lab\nreports submitted by peers.\nThe lab work will be supported and extended by short lecture videos in\nwhich short conceptual \"clicker\" questions are integrated.

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment from Georgia Tech C21U.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?&nbsp; You will need: an Internet connection access to a computer where you can install and can use the free, open-source software we will need for video analysis and for computer modeling. It would be good if the computer you use had a spreadsheet program (at times, we will make scatter plots in spreadsheets); however, if necessary, you can use the free spreadsheet on Google docs. a digital camera of some type (cellphone camera, web camera, point-and-shoot digital camera) and a way to transfer images from that camera to the computer you will use for the course.&nbsp; "}

This introductory physics course is intended for physical science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. It closely parallels the brick-and-mortar course given to the freshmen at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The course covers classical mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications. This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion.\u00a0 How does gravity control the motion of the\nplanets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon?\u00a0 Why does a spinning skater spin faster when\nshe pulls her arms in? \u00a0Why is a\nperpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can\nbe answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac\nNewton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of\nphysics, but it will never go out of style.\u00a0\nIt remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and\nis constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called\nNew Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July\n14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed\nusing classical mechanics, and nothing\nmore.Syllabus\nWeek 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1D motion: speed, velocity and acceleration\nWeek 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1D motion continued.\u00a0\u00a0\nVector Math.\nWeek 3: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Motion in 2D.\nWeek 4: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Newton\u2019s Laws.\nWeek 5: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Applications of Newton\u2019s Laws.\u00a0 Friction.\nWeek 6: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work and Energy.\nWeek 7: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation of Energy.

The confluence of multi-core and distributed-core processors, inexpensive mass storage, ubiquitous wireless connectivity, and commodity software platforms is driving the need for&nbsp;software engineers and programmers&nbsp;who understand how to develop concurrent&nbsp;and networked software for mobile devices that connect to cloud computing platforms. Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover, developing high quality reusable concurrent and&nbsp;networked software apps and services is even harder. &nbsp;The principles, methods, and&nbsp;skills required to develop such software are best learned by&nbsp;attaining mastery of&nbsp;patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks. A pattern&nbsp;describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a pattern language that defines a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A&nbsp;framework&nbsp;is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code. This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to&nbsp;alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked&nbsp;software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques, Javaprogramming language features, and&nbsp;Android&nbsp;middleware. An extended case study project will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase pattern-oriented software design and programming techniques&nbsp;for concurrent and networked mobile devices and clouds.\nNote: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled Mobile Cloud Computing with Android\nThis MOOC and two others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform, structured as follows: The University of Maryland MOOC, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, will run from January 21st - April 28th. It focuses on the design and programming of user-facing applications. &nbsp; The first Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems, will run from May 12th - July 6th. It focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp; The second Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems, will be run from July 21st - September 29th. It focuses on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. The final Capstone project MOOC in the sequence will run from October 1st - November 3rd. For this first offering of the Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization only students in the Signature Track who receive a \"Verified Certificate with Distinction\" are eligible to enroll in the Capstone project course. Some of the programming assignments and the iRemember integrative project for these MOOCs will be coordinated.&nbsp; If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you\u2019re certainly welcome to do so, and you\u2019ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you\u2019ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.Syllabus\nThe course is organized into the following sections:Section 0: Course IntroductionPart 1: Overview of Mobile Cloud Computing with AndroidPart 2:Course Structure and TopicsPart 3: Course Prerequisites and Learning StrategiesPart 4: Overview of Patterns and FrameworksSection 1: Android ConcurrencyModule 1: Concurrency Motivations and ChallengesPart 1: Concurrency MotivationsPart 2: Concurrency ChallengesModule 2: Java Concurrency MechanismsPart 1: Overview of Java Threads (Part 1)Part 2: Overview of Java Threads (Part 2)Part 3: Motivating Java Synchronization &amp; Scheduling MechanismsPart 4: Java Synchronization and Scheduling ClassesPart 5: Java ReentrantLockPart 6: Java ReentrantReadWriteLockPart 7: Java SemaphorePart 8: Java ConditionObjectPart 9: Java CountDownLatchPart 10: Java Synchronization and Scheduling ExamplePart 11: Java Built-in Monitor ObjectsModule 3: Android Concurrency FrameworksPart 1: Overview of Android Concurrency Frameworks and IdiomsPart 2: Android LooperPart 3: Overview of Android HandlerPart 4: Posting and Processing Runnables to Android HandlerPart 5: Sending and Handling Messages to Android HandlerPart 6: The AsyncTask Framework (Part 1)Part 7: The AsyncTask Framework (Part 2)Part 8: Programming with Android Concurrency Frameworks (Part 1)Part 9: Programming with Android Concurrency Frameworks (Part 2)Section 2: Android Services and SecurityModule 1: Android Services and IPCPart 1: Overview of Started and Bound ServicesPart 2: Programming Started Services (Part 1)Part 3: Programming Started Services (Part 2)Part 4: Android IntentServicePart 5: Activity and Service CommunicationPart 6: Service to Activity Communication Using Android MessengerPart 7: Programming Bound Services with Messengers (Part 1)Part 8: Programming Bound Services with Messengers (Part 2)Part 9: Programming Bound Services with AIDLModule 2: Android App Security and RisksPart 1: Traditional App AccountsPart 2: Mobile vs. Traditional App AccountsPart 3: App Account Mapping to Linux UsersPart 4: Apps Lie &amp; StealPart 5: How Android Protects AppsPart 6: What Android Doesn't ProtectPart 7: Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Public LocationsPart 8: Risks of Insecure File PermissionsModule 3: Building More Secure Android AppsPart 0: The Challenge of Secure CodingPart 1: Security Vulnerability WalkthroughPart 2: Principles of Secure AbstractionsPart 3: Avoid Coupling Data &amp; Security StatePart 4: Build Abstractions that are Hard to Use InsecurelyPart 5: Bound &amp; Strongly Type Security StatePart 6: Avoid Conditional Logic in Secure PathwaysPart 7: Prevent Secure Pathways from Being Broken at RuntimePart 8: Privilege Escalation ConceptsPart 9: Privilege Escalation ScenarioPart 10: Privilege Escalation Code WalkthroughPart 11: Privilege Escalation FixesPart 12: User Interface AttacksPart 13: Cross-platform User Interface AttacksSection 3: Concurrency and Communication Patterns in AndroidModule 1: Coordinating Concurrent Access to Shared DataPart 1: The Monitor Object Pattern (Part 1)Part 2: The Monitor Object Pattern (Part 2)Module 2: Activating Services on DemandPart 1: The Activator Pattern (Part 1)Part 2: The Activator Pattern (Part 2)Module 3: Passing Commands to ServicesPart 1: The Command Processor Pattern (Part 1)Part 2: The Command Processor Pattern (Part 2)Module 4: Automating Marshaling and Demarshaling of DataPart 1: The Proxy Pattern (Part 1)Part 2: The Proxy Pattern (Part 2)Module 5: Supporting Object-Oriented Remote Method CallsPart 1: The Broker Pattern (Part 1)Part 2: The Broker Pattern (Part 2)Module 6: Decoupling Producers from ConsumersPart 1: The Publisher-Subscriber Pattern (Part 1)Part 2: The Publisher-Subscriber Pattern (Part 2)Module 7: Ensuring Only One Looper Per ThreadPart 1: The Thread-Specific Storage PatternModule 8: Passing Message Requests Between ThreadsPart 1: The Active Object PatternModule 9: Decoupling Synchronous &amp; Synchronous ProcessingPart 1: the Half-Sync/Half-Async PatternThroughout the MOOC we'll focus on pattern-oriented software architecture, with an emphasis on concurrent and networked programming in the context of Android middleware systems programming mechanisms, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, storage and retrieval of structured data, and local inter-process communication (IPC) and networking. We illustrate&nbsp;by example&nbsp;how key pattern and framework concepts and relationships are applied in Android Services, Content Providers, Broadcast Receivers, and various secure local and remote IPC mechanisms from both an application and infrastructure perspective. Many code examples are shown throughout using Java, with a case study project used to reify the key points throughout all the modules in this section.The PDF versions of all the slides used in the course will be available online as the videos become available on the course website.Recommended Background\nIdeally, students who take this course&nbsp;will be&nbsp;familiar with general&nbsp;object-oriented design and programming concepts (such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, extensibility, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) ), fundamental object-oriented programming&nbsp;language features (such as classes, inheritance, dynamic binding, and&nbsp;generics available in Java, basic systems programming concepts (such as event handling,&nbsp;processes/threads, synchronization, interprocess&nbsp;communication, and dynamic linking), and networking terminology (such as client/server and peer-to-peer&nbsp;architectures, TCP/IP, and layering).&nbsp; We will review object-oriented design, systems programming, and networking concepts and techniques, so students who understand how to read/write Java code examples should be fine.Suggested Readings\nAlthough the lectures are designed to be largely self-contained, it's recommended (but not required) that students refer to the following books: Mark Murphy, The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development, CommonsWare.

It consists of lecture videos with integrated quiz&nbsp;questions designed to ensure students understand the material covered in the videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition that not all students have the same learning objectives or available time, the POSA MOOC is offered at the following two levels of engagement:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal Track&nbsp;\u2013 Estimated Time Commitment:&nbsp;&nbsp;3 \u2013 4 Hours Per Week. Students at this level will be assessed by weekly auto-graded standalone quizzes.&nbsp; This track is designed for those who wish to engage the material by taking the auto-graded quizzes, as well as participating in the online discussion forums, but who may not have the time/interest to complete the auto-/peer-graded programming assignments. &nbsp;Distinction Track&nbsp;\u2013 Estimated Time Commitment:&nbsp;8 \u2013&nbsp;12 Hours Per Week. In addition to completing the auto-graded weekly quizzes from the Normal Track, students in this track will also complete auto-/peer-graded programming assignments. These programming assignments will involve writing concurrent Android Services and Applications&nbsp;using its pattern-oriented frameworks written in Java, This track is designed for those students wishing to achieve mastery of the POSA MOOC material and to understand its application in realistic project context.&nbsp;Students need not explicitly choose which of these two Tracks to take since Statement of Accomplishment will automatically be generated corresponding to the work students successfully perform in the POSA MOOC. In particular, the grading system will first assume the students are doing Distinction Track. If the students don't qualify for Distinction Track, the system will fallback to Normal Track grading, which grade only based on the quizzes, as discussed below.&nbsp;The final grade for the course will be calculated as follows:Weekly quizzes&nbsp;(Weighting: 100% for \"Normal Track\" and 30% for \"Distinction Track\")Each quiz will contain a number of equally-weighted questions. You will have until noon central time on the last day of the class (July 6th) to submit the quiz. &nbsp;There will be roughly eight quizzes.Programming assignments&nbsp;(Weighting: 70% for \"Distinction Track\" and not applicable for \"Normal Track\")You will have&nbsp;N&nbsp;programming assignments (where&nbsp;N&nbsp;== 8) by the end of the course. You will have roughly 14 days to submit your solution. The total weekly assignment score will be 70% of the final course score for students taking the \"Distinction Track\". Each assignment will account for 1/Nth of the total programming assignment points, so it's possible to miss an assignment or two and still pass the class as long as you do well on the other assignments. &nbsp;Statements of AccomplishmentStudents who earn a final grade greater than or equal to 70% on the quizzes will receive a Statement of Accomplishment for the \"Normal Track\".&nbsp;Students who wish to receive a Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;with Distinction, however, must complete the programming assignments for the \"Distinction Track\", as described above.&nbsp;Signature TrackCoursera also offers the&nbsp;Signature Track, which is orthogonal to the Normal Track and Distinction Track described above. The main purpose of Signature Track is to verify the identity of students. Students in the Signature Track can either receive a Verified Certificate (which involves meeting the criteria from the \"Normal Track\" described above) or a Verified Certificate with Distinction (which involves meeting the criteria rom the \"Distinction Track\" described above). &nbsp;It's &nbsp;mandatory for students in the Signature Track to successfully achieve a Verified Certificate with Distinction to take the Capstone project at the end of the MoCCA Specialization.FAQ\nThe 2014 POSA FAQ is located here"}

{"lang": "en", "name": "Functional Programming Principles in Scala", "cat": "5/computer_science|8/engineering_technology", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 391, "desc": "Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming. Gain practice in writing clean functional code, using the Scala programming language. This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that\u2019s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.Syllabus\nWeek One: Programming paradigms; overview of functional programming and the Scala programming language.\nWeek Two: Defining and using functions, recursion and non-termination, working with functions as values, reasoning by reduction.\u00a0\nWeek Three: Defining and using immutable objects, review of inheritance and dynamic binding.\nWeek Four: Types and Pattern Matching\nWeek Five:\u00a0Working with Lists\nWeek Six:\u00a0Collections and Combinatorial Search\nWeek Seven: Lazy EvaluationRecommended Background\nYou should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient.\nSuggested Readings\nThe class is designed to be self-contained. For further reading on some of the ideas in the course, we recommend Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) by Abelson and Sussman, published by MIT Press. For learning more about Scala, we recommend Programming in Scala: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide, 2nd Edition by Odersky, Spoon and Venners, published by Artima Press, or else Scala for the Impatient, by Horstmann, published by Addison Wesley.Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 6 and 15 minutes in length. These contain integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures.FAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nYou should have the following installed: - Java Virtual Machine JDK 1.6 or higher. - A Scala distribution version 2.9 or higher The recommended development environment for the course is the Scala IDE for Eclipse. It comes with a Scala distribution so if you intend to work only in Eclipse you just need to install the Scala IDE.\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nWrite elegant code that works the first time it is run.\n"}

Use the programming languages ML, Racket, and Ruby in ways that will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts. Gain new software skills and the concepts needed to learn new languages on your own. Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. Use functional programming and contrast it with\nobject-oriented programming. Through experience writing programs and studying\nthree different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using\nprogramming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefits\nof static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoretical\nnor just about programming specifics \u2013 it will give you a framework for\nunderstanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design\ncorrect and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn to\nthink more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.\nThe emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to\nwrite robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs \u2013 in any language.\nBeginning with the Fall 2014 offering, verified certificates are available for this course. The certificates look slightly different than for courses from other institutions. Here is an example.\nSyllabus\nNote: About half the students completing prior offerings report an estimated workload of 8-12 hours / week is accurate while most of the other half spent more time -- 15 hours / week or more. Workload naturally differs for different people depending on one's background. Do see the recommended-background section below.\nTopics (most of which may not mean anything to you until you take the course): Syntax vs. semantics vs. idioms vs. libraries vs. tools ML basics (bindings, conditionals, records, functions) Recursive functions and recursive types Benefits of no mutation Algebraic datatypes, pattern matching Tail recursion First-class functions and function closures Lexical scope Currying Syntactic sugar Equivalence and effects Parametric polymorphism and container types Type inference Abstract types and modules Racket basics Dynamic vs. static typing Laziness, streams, and memoization Implementing languages, especially higher-order functions Macros Eval Ruby basics Object-oriented programming is dynamic dispatch Pure object-orientation Implementing dynamic dispatch Multiple inheritance, interfaces, and mixins OOP vs. functional decomposition and extensibility Subtyping for records, functions, and objects Subtyping Class-based subtyping Subtyping vs. parametric polymorphism; bounded polymorphism\nRecommended Background\nThe course assumes students are familiar with programming covered by most\nintroductory courses -- this is not an introductory programming course.\u00a0 Conversely, it is also not a particularly advanced course -- a couple good prior programming courses should be enough.\u00a0 Students should be comfortable with variables, conditionals,\narrays, linked lists, stacks, and recursion (though recursion will be reviewed\nand expanded upon), and the difference between an interface and an implementation.\nStudents should be eager to write programs in languages new to them.\u00a0 Later parts\nof the course analyze basic object-oriented concepts and contrast them\nwith those of other languages, so familiarity with Java or a closely related\nlanguage (e.g., C#) is helpful, but not required for homework assignments.Suggested Readings\nCourse videos and programming exercises serve as the bulk of class content.\nWritten notes by the instructor are also available and serve as a valuable\nresource.Course Format\nVideo segments have short question-and-answer sections, but the main work\nwill be seven homework assignments that involve writing small programs.\nThe programming assignments will be automatically graded and students\nwill peer-assess each other's submissions for style. Critiquing other\u2019s\nwork and receiving comments about your own are invaluable learning experiences.\nThe course also has a midterm exam and a final exam."}
{"lang": "en", "name": "Introduction to Systematic Program Design - Part 1", "cat": "5/computer_science|8/engineering_technology", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 393, "desc": "This course is about learning to program well: building programs that are elegant, well tested and easy to maintain. The course is designed for students with no programming experience at all. Nonetheless, former students who already knew how to program have said it made them better programmers. Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming a more and more valuable skill.\nTo build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general skill of how to design a program.\nThis course presents a design method that will enable you to approach the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop in the future.\nUsing this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach. The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and to test your program as you develop it.\nIn the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards.&nbsp;A second phase of the course, to be offered later, &nbsp;will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem domain interests you.Syllabus\nWeek One: Introduction and the structure of the course. The Beginning\nStudent Language; expressions and evaluation rules; primitive\noperations on numbers, strings and images. The How to Design Functions\n(HtDF) Recipe.\nWeek Two: Representing information as data. The How to Design Data\n(HtDD) recipe. Atomic forms of data including intervals, enumerations,\nand itemizations.\nWeek Three: The design of simple interactive programs. The big-bang\nuser interface framework. The How to Design Worlds (HtDW)\nrecipe. Representing information where two or more values naturally\nform a whole using compound data.\nWeek Four: Representing arbitrary sized information using\nlists. Decomposition of information into multiple types.\nWeek Five: Functions operating on natural numbers. A parlor\ntrick. Rules for decomposing functions.\nWeek Six: List abbreviations. Mutual reference allows more complex\narbitrary-sized data. Using binary trees to enable fast lookup of\ninformation. Using arbitrary arity trees to represent inherently\nhierarchical information.\nWeek Seven: Functions that consume two arguments that have 'one-of' in\ntheir types. Using local definitions to improve the structure of\nprograms.\nWeek Eight: Using abstraction to control reduce repetition and\ncomplexity in programs.\nWeek Nine: Generative recursion, fractals and search problems.\nRecommended Background\nNo prior programming experience is assumed, and only a grade school math background is required.Suggested Readings\nA detailed description of the design method, as\nwell as weekly lecture notes will be available online. No textbook is required,\nbut the second edition of How to Design Programs, by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt and\nKrishnamurthi is valuable supplementary reading; the book is available online at no cost.Course Format\nThe course will include weekly video lecture material as well as assigned\ndesign problems. There will also be two small projects and a final exam. Because programs must be written to be read by others the two projects will be peer graded. This will give students experience with reading code written by peers and having their code evaluated by peers.FAQ\nCan students ask questions? We will use an on-line discussion group to enable students to ask and answer questions. Course staff will monitor the group to ensure accuracy of student answers as well as to handle unanswered questions.\nWhat programming languages will the\ncourse use?\nThis course -- Part 1 of a 2 course sequence -- uses a teaching language called Beginning\nStudent Language. Part 2 will be broken into parallel\ntracks that tackle problems in different domains using one or more popular\nlanguages such as Python and Javascript.What resources will I need for this class?For this course all you need is an internet connection and a computer. The software we will use is available for free download, and the supplementary text is also available online for free."}

All areas of psychology will be covered. Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict,\nand to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers,\nand later our friends and companions. This course shows, however,\nhow the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific\nvalidation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology\nhas learned how people behave and think.\nPsychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include\ndiscussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception,\nlearning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion\nand motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and\npsychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short\nlecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments.\nSyllabus\nThis is a twelve-week Introductory Psychology course that is usually taught in the first year of college. There is a Spring Break during the week of March 17-21, 2014. Psychology is a broad discipline as you can see in the outline, and the course will\nsurvey the many areas studied by psychologists. Psychologists study the mind and behavior.\nThis course was funded by a generous grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The QM certification mark recognizes that this course met Quality Matters review standards.\nPrerequisite Knowledge\nThere are no prerequisites for this course.\nOnline Resources\nWe will be using material developed by Carnegie Mellon University called the Open Learning Initiative. The OLI material is divided into 56 modules and the course outline indicates which modules will be covered each week. Learning objectives are given\nat the beginning of each module.\nGrading Policy\nThere will be a multiple choice quiz at the end of each week of lecture (11 quizzes total). The quizzes will be timed and you can only take each quiz only once. Quizzes will be available from 5:00 PM EST on Friday of each week until 5:00 PM on the next\nWednesday. The lowest quiz score will be automatically dropped. There will be a final exam at the end of the course. The overall allocation of quizzes and projects to the final grade are as follows:: Quiz average: 50% of final grade Final examination: 50% of final grade\nA total score of 70% or higher will guarantee a passing grade in the course and a Statement of Accomplishment. Earning a score of 85% or higher will guarantee a passing grade in the course and a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.\nCommunication\nPlease communicate with the instructor and staff via the online forums. Because there are so many students, it is not possible for us to respond individually to every question. There will be a Q&amp;A forum where you can post your questions about the\ncourse. Students will have the opportunity to \"vote up\" questions they want answered, and the questions with the most votes will be answered either in a forum post or a video. Announcements from the instructor about the course will be sent via e-mail\nto all registered students and also will appear on the announcement page.\nNetiquette\nWritten English language will be the primary means of communication. Please interact with your fellow students and the instructor in the discussion forums. There can be miscommunication as there is no intonation in these written communications. Please\nbe positive, supportive, and constructive in your comments and forum postings.\nExpectations\nParticipants are expected to: Watch all lecture videos every week Complete all quizzes and the final examination Abide by the standards of academic honesty \u2013 plagiarism and any form of cheating will not be tolerated and will result in the removal of the participant from the course Seek help if needed from your fellow students by using the forums\nHonesty\nYour answers on quizzes and the exam should be your own.\nCourse Goals\nUpon successful completion of the course, students will be able to describe what psychologists study. They will be exposed to basic information about the different areas of psychology listed as different modules in OLI and weekly topics in the outline.\nThey will understand that we can understand behavior only by doing research to uncover the facts.\nSpecific course goals are: Students will be able to recognize and describe major psychological principles, theories, and perspectives. Students will be able to distinguish between different methods used by psychologists to study the different areas of psychology. Students will be able to describe the nature-nurture controversy across different areas of psychology. Students will know the basic principles in each area of psychology and how good research is required to understand these principles. For each area of psychology, students will know how the nervous system and other biological systems are involved in understanding behavior in that area.\nCourse Outline Week Topic Modules OLI Modules Week 1 January 13-17 Psychology as a Science a.

The course emphasizes the\necological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple\nnatural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, the\nhealth of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, and\ndemographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is to\nunderstand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amounts\nof disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventing\ndisease.&nbsp;\nStudents in the course will explore successful examples in\npublic health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policies\nhave both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. How\nsocioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of risk\nintervention and disease prevention strategies.

Similarly, educational success also requires the ability to articulate your thoughts clearly. In this class, we will study the principles of public speaking; critically examine our own and others\u2019 speeches through interactive practice. The\noverriding goal of this course is to demystify the process of writing,\npracticing, and performing a clear and engaging speech. In so doing, I hope\nthis course can help each student improve the quality of their speeches and\nconfidence with which they present them. More\nspecifically, upon successfully completing this course, you should be able to: design\nand deliver basic presentations concisely; design\nand deliver informative presentations clearly; design\nand deliver complex arguments persuasively; speak\nconfidently with appropriate rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety;\u00a0\nevaluate\nand critique speeches insightfully.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Course overview and key terms Week 2: Preparing impromptu speechesWeek 3: Delivering impromptu speechesWeek 4: Informative speech basics Week 5: Preparing informative speechesWeek 6: Delivering informative speechesWeek 7: Persuasive speech basicsWeek 8: Preparing persuasive speechesWeek 9: Delivering persuasive speechesWeek 10: Course ConclusionRecommended Background\nIf\nyou wish to complete the three speech assignments, you must have access to\nvideo recording equipment (e.g., digital camera, cell phone, flip camera,\nwebcam, or video camera) and the ability to share this digital content via\nYouTube, Vimeo, or Aparat. Since\nthere is no certificate, the uploading of speeches is entirely optional.\nStudents who choose to not post video will not be denied any access to the\ncourse content.Course Format\nIn\ndesigning this course, I wanted to provide a wide range of activities and\nassignments for the wide range of student interest and needs. Some students may\nwant only to watch the video lectures and take the quizzes; others may invest\nmore fully and post sample videos and participate actively in discussion\nforums. Here are some of the course assignments and activities: Video lectures: Most of the course content is delivered through a number\nof video lectures. Each video runs 8-12 minutes and teaches a specific public\nspeaking ability or concept. Discussion forums: This class thrives on discussion. There are a number of\ndiscussion forums that emerge from the lectures and sample speeches. You will\nhave the ability to articulate your views on public speaking as well as learn\nfrom your peers. Quizzes:\nMany video lectures have short quizzes embedded that reinforce basic knowledge\nof certain concepts and argument structures. Speech Analysis and Modeling: One of the best ways to\nrefine your own speech ability is through a close study of others' speeches. We\nwill have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches and\nspeakers. Peer Assessment Assignments: There are four optional\nspeech assignments: an impromptu, informative, and persuasive speech. Students\ncan elect to record and post videos of their speeches. FAQ\nHow\nlong will the course take to complete?\nThe course will require approximately 3-5 hours of your time\nper week in total effort. Is\nthere a statement of completion or certificate issued for this course?\nNo, there is no statement of completion or credential any type awarded for this course. Can\nI stop the lecture stream and/or the assessment quizzes without losing work?\nThe lectures are essentially like YouTube videos, so if you\nstop it mid-stream, you can just start it again.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Rationing and Allocating Scarce Medical Resources", "cat": "12/medicine_health", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 400, "desc": "This course will explore the complex challenges of allocating scarce medical resources at both the micro and macro level. Students will learn the theories behind allocation and use modern examples to explore how society makes the difficult decisions that arise when there is not enough to go around. You have one liver but three patients awaiting a liver transplant. Who should get the liver? What criteria should be used to select the recipient? Is it fair to give it to an alcoholic? These are some of the questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce health care resources among particular individuals, and concern what are called micro-allocation decisions. But trade-offs also need to be made at the meso- and macro-level. Budgets of public payers of healthcare, such as governments, and of private ones, such as health plans, are limited: they cannot cover all drugs and services that appear beneficial to patients or physicians. So what services should they provide? Is there a core set of benefits that everyone should be entitled to? How can we make fair decisions, if we know from the outset than not all needs can be met? Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and drug shortages, the course will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce resources among individuals, while also exploring the principles and values that underlie those theories.\nSyllabus\nLogistics and Grading\nThis class is seven weeks long. Each week, students will watch approximate 30 - 40 minutes of lectures by Dr. Emanuel. Students should expect to spend 2 - 5 hours per week reading related materials from the reading list, all of which are freely accessible online.\nStudents taking the course for a grade will complete one quiz (also referred to throughout the course as a peer assessment) per week, which will be peer-graded based on a detailed answer key provided after the due date. Of the seven scores earned for assignments, the lowest two scores will be dropped in calculating the final grade. The remaining five scores will be weighted equally. As a result, students who miss a homework assignment can still earn full credit in the course. There are no exams or final projects in this course. Students not taking the course for a grade may choose not to complete the assignments.\nThe details of these logistics are subject to change; if changes are made, students will be notified via an announcement and this page will be updated.\nCourse Outline\nWeek 1: \"Who Gets the Liver?\" &amp; History of Rationing\nWe begin the course with a hypothetical case. We have one liver and three patients who will die if they don't get a transplant. We will discuss some of the potential approaches for making life and death decisions in the context of absolute scarcity. Next we will explore the history of rationing in medicine. Absolute scarcity has always been a problem. How have we dealt with this problem in the past? We'll take a look at what happened in the cases of three major 20th century medial advances: insulin, penicillin, and dialysis.\nWeek 2: Conceptual Distinctions\nThe study of rationing was borne out of the concept of absolute scarcity in medicine--cases in which the demand for medical care far exceeds the resources existing to meet that need. Because demand will inevitably exceed supply--no matter what--choices must be made about which patients receive treatment, and which don't. But what do we really mean when we use the term 'rationing?' Is there a difference between the terms rationing, resource allocation, and priority-setting? In this lecture, we will attempt to explain the conceptual distinctions that give meaning to the terms we use in this course.\nWeek 3: Organs for Transplantation\nKidneys, livers, hearts, and lungs are among the most discussed absolutely scarce medical resources. And their allocation poses some of the most vexing ethical dilemmas. The lecture for this week will break down the process by which organs for transplantation are allocated in the United States through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We will discuss some of the values and principles that are implicitly favored in the UNOS rules and grapple with a few particularly difficult cases. Should alcoholics with cirrhosis be eligible to receive a liver transplant, if their receiving a liver means a person with a \"blameless\" liver disease will die as a result? What role should socioeconomic or legal status play in organ transplantation? Do you agree with the UNOS policies as written?\nWeek 4: Theories\nThis week, we will explore some of the moral schools of thought that have shaped the modern-day study of bioethics, and have a tremendous impact on health policy. Deontology regards morality as the driving guide behind our choices of what we ought to do. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, views the proper course of action as the one that maximizes utility. The tension between these two ethical theories highlights the ethical dilemmas that bioethicists face in determining how to ration scarce medical resources.\nWeek 5: Values &amp; Principles\nValue judgments are inescapable in rationing decisions. But what are the competing values and principles that are inherently at play? How can one choose among them? This week's lecture explores 4 key values and 8 guiding principles that ethicists and policymakers must consider when confronting rationing decisions. We'll look at the distinctions between the values and principles, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. Additionally, we'll examine the Complete Lives System, which is a theoretical framework designed to draw upon multiple principles and values.\nWeek 6: Flu Emergency\nThis week, we will explore another real life example of rationing in action. What should we do if there is a major flu pandemic and there isn't enough vaccine to go around? Who should get the limited vaccine and who should not? We'll examine the U.S. Government's actual policy for major health crises. For example, we will look at Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) briefs that deal with allocation protocols in the event of an influenza pandemic. We will also look into historical examples of flu crises, and analyze the ethical approaches taken in specific case studies.\nWeek 7: From Micro to Macro\nFor the final week of the course, we'll examine the difference between micro rationing decisions and meso/macro decisions. We'll look at the case of Shep Glazer, whose testimony before Congress fundamentally changed the way dialysis treatment was allocated in the United States. We'll also look briefly at cost effectiveness analysis and the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) as tools for macro level decisions. What paradoxes arise when using these tools? Do they favor some people over others? What values are implicit in policies that draw upon cost-effectiveness and QALYs?\nFAQ\nWill I get a&nbsp;Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment&nbsp;signed by the instructor.\nFor more information on Penn\u2019s Open Learning initiative, please go to:http://openlearning.upenn.edu/"}
{"lang": "en", "name": "Principles of Reactive Programming", "cat": "5/computer_science|8/engineering_technology", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 401, "desc": "Learn how to write composable software that stays responsive at all times by being elastic under load and resilient in the presence of failures. Model systems after human organizations or inter-human communication. This is a follow-on for the Coursera class \u201cPrinciples of Functional Programming in Scala\u201d, which so far had more than 100\u2019000 inscriptions over two iterations of the course, with some of the highest completion rates of any massive open online course worldwide.The aim of the second course is to teach the principles of reactive programming. Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state&nbsp;by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of message-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Review of Principles of Functional Programming: substitution model, for-expressions and how they relate to monads. Introduces a new implementation of for-expressions: random value generators. Shows how this can be used in randomized testing and gives an overview of ScalaCheck, a tool which implements this idea.Week 2: Functional programming and mutable state. What makes an object mutable? How this impacts the substitution model. Extended example: Digital circuit simulation.Week 3: Futures. Introduces futures as another monad, with for-expressions as concrete syntax. Shows how futures can be composed to avoid thread blocking. Discusses cross-thread error handling.Week 4: Reactive stream processing. \u00a0Generalizing futures to reactive computations over streams. Stream operators.Week 5: Actors. Introduces the Actor Model, actors as encapsulated units of consistency, asynchronous message passing, discusses different message delivery semantics (at most once, at least once, exactly once) and eventual consistency.Week 6: Supervision. Introduces reification of failure, hierarchical failure handling, the Error Kernel pattern, lifecycle monitoring, discusses transient and persistent state.Week 7: Conversation Patterns. Discusses the management of conversational state between actors and patterns for flow control, routing of messages to pools of actors for resilience or load balancing, acknowledgement of reception to achieve reliable delivery.Recommended Background\nYou should have a background equivalent to someone who completed the course \u201cPrinciples of Functional Programming\u201d. We assume you know the fundamentals of functional programming and the Scala language.Suggested Readings\nThe class is designed to be self-contained, based on the ideas expressed in the&nbsp;Reactive Manifesto. For further reading on data structures and language concepts we recommend&nbsp;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)\n&nbsp;by Abelson and Sussman, published by MIT Press. For further reading on concurrent systems we recommend Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming by Peter van Roy and Seif Haridi, published by MIT Press. For learning more about Scala, we recommend&nbsp;Programming in Scala: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide, 2nd Edition &nbsp;by Odersky, Spoon and Venners, published by Artima Press, or else&nbsp;Scala for the Impatient , by Horstmann, published by Addison Wesley. More in-depth background on reactive systems is available in the upcoming book Reactive Design Patterns&nbsp;by Kuhn and Allen, to be published by Manning (currently in early access).Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos of about 1\u20132 hours per week split in multiple smaller parts. These contain integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures.FAQ\nWill I get a certificate after completing this class?Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.What resources will I need for this class?You should have the following installed: - Java Virtual Machine JDK 1.6 or higher. - A Scala distribution version 2.10 or higher The recommended development environment for the course is the Scala IDE for Eclipse. It comes with a Scala distribution so if you intend to work only in Eclipse you just need to install the Scala IDE.What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?You will learn how to write programs which scale from one mobile phone up to thousands of servers."}

We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues, then two more weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato; that is, we will consider some contemporary manifestations of issues Plato discusses. Our focus will be: moral theory and moral psychology. \"The safest general characterization of the European\nphilosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\u201d\n\u2013 A. N. WhiteheadIt\nturns out: the more you blow up your beliefs as you go, the more they stay the same.Why\n\u2018Reason and Persuasion\u2019? The title is generic, and indicates that the course\nwill be - if this is what you are looking for - a general, introduction to\nphilosophy, as it tends to be taught at the university level. But the title\nalso points to a specific problem: reason without persuasion is useless;\npersuasion without reason is dangerous. Plato worried about it. So will we.The\ncourse will be of interest to a wide variety of students. There are a variety\nof reasons why you might want to know at least a little about what Plato\nthought and wrote. I will do my best to teach in a way that accommodates as\nwide a range of likely interests in the subject as i can manage.Syllabus\nWEEK 1 \u2013 IntroductionsTo the course; to philosophy; to Plato and Socrates; to the dialogue form; to Plato\u2019s Euthyphro. Who are these people? Why are they interesting? WEEK 2 - Plato's Euthyphro: Two ProblemsOne practical,\none definitional. 1) Euthyphro thinks his dad is a murderer. What should you do in a case like that? 2) what is holiness? Add a few thoughts about the ancient Athenian justice system. What would be an ideal justice system for handling such a case? Also, what good is it talking to Euthyphro\nif he isn't the sort of person who's ever going to listen? (Especially if you humiliate him like that.) WEEK 3 \u2013 Plato\u2019s Meno: What is virtue?Final reflections on Euthyphro, with notes about Greek tragedy. What's our best guess\nabout what Plato is getting at, writing a dialogue that seems to go nowhere? Then, Meno: new characters and a new problem. What is virtue? Meno means\nsomething like this: what does it take to be a success? To be excellent! But soon Socrates has turned everything strange. Meno, like Euthyphro, is bad at this game. What are some basic ethical theories?WEEK 4 - Plato's Meno: Virtue - Geometry - Virtue. This dialogue has a funny\nstructure. A piece of math between two slices of virtue. Not to worry, reader! Meno finds it as unpalatable as you do. The key turns out to be : we need to understand the nature of the mind; its basic relationship to the world.\nPlato has a bold but strange model of the mind, and the relationship between ethics and mathematics. We end on a practical note: Meno is sure 1) that he knows it all; 2) that nothing can really be known. This makes him hard to teach. It's good to notice this about people.\nWEEK 5 - Plato's Republic, Book I: Again, With Fathers and SonsWhat is justice? Socrates faces a series of three debating partners. Two are easy: the father-son tag-team, Cephalus and Polemarchus.\nBut the Boss Fight - against Thrasymachus - is hard. But Cephalus - nice old retired businessman - and his honor-loving, earnest son are interesting. They aren't clever at debate (how many people are?) but they're real. That makes\nthem important. Also, Book I is Plato's gateway into Republic. (Who knew the guys at the gates of Utopia would be such regular guys?) So I should say something about all that.WEEK 6 - Plato's Republic, Book I: Thrasymachus. Is it in my self-interest to be just? Isn't justice just a second-best option for those who don't have what it takes to be tyrants? Worse: isn't justice just whatever those who rule say it is. So: justice is the advantage of the stronger. Thrasymachus is a cynic, but it's hard to deny he's got half a point. He's a better debater, too. Thoughts about egoism and altruism. WEEK 7 - Moral Psychology I am going to discuss a popular 'positive psychology' book, by Jonathan Haidt, The Happiness Hypothesis. It's a good book, and a useful snapshot of\nPlato's legacy. Haidt is, in some ways, very Platonic; in other ways, very anti-Platonic. Haidt is interested in providing a basically rational account of how the moral mind works - pretty irrationally, it turns out. He wants to improve our knowledge and have it make a real ethical difference. What a rational way to live if you are going to live irrationally?WEEK 8 \u2013 Ethics and EthnosWe end, where we began, thinking\nabout the ways in-group/out-group relations structure our ethical thinking. We turn from Jonathan Haidt to Joshua Greene's book, Moral Tribes. Greene, like Haidt, studies moral psychology. He's more on Plato's side than Haidt - without actually being a Platonist. I'll try to bring out how, even if Plato is a bit out of date, empirically (no denying it!) studying Plato still provides us with useful categories for carving up the intellectual landscape. He can help you find your way around, even if you don't decide to follow him very far.Recommended Background\nHere is our textbook.\nUPDATE: As you may have noted, Amazon does not have the book in stock. Here's the situation. There WILL be a new (4th) edition by the time the course starts. It probably won't be available in print from Amazon before the course starts (but I'm trying!) but it will be available in shiny, cutting-edge PDF. And this PDF will not be print-locked like the old one. So paper will be available to all, even if you have to spend your own toner on it. It will also be available on Kindle but, since I have to arrange all that myself, it may take time. (Turning a book with so many illustrations into an EPUB is fiddly.)Suggested Readings\nJonathan Haidt, The Happiness Hypothesis [book site, including substantial excerpts]Joshua Greene, Moral Tribes [link to video of the author. No free excerpts from the book itself on the web.]I recommend both titles. They are good reads! But, if you don't want to buy, there are enough free resources concerning both authors - including lots of videos of both - that you can make-do with web-stuff.Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos - generally about 90 minutes per week. There are some quizzes and there will be a short essay (peer assessed).FAQ\nTo earn a Verified Certificate, you must join Signature Track to verify your identity and earn a a final grade of at least 70% in the course. If you verify your identity and earn a grade of 90% or above, you will receive a Verified Certificate with Distinction.\nIf you choose not to verify your identity, you can receive a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction according to the same passing thresholds.\n"}

In particular, we will present the Europeana Data Model, a framework for collecting, connecting and enriching data on cultural objects provided by a number of museum, archives, sites and libraries in Europe. Syllabus\nCourse\nProgram and Goals of the week\nModule 1 (first week):The recovery of the human past and\nthe protection of the universal heritage. We will start our enquiry by\ndiscussing how ancient societies kept memory of their own past, an aspect which,\nin fact, was fundamental to their identity. Shifting towards modern times, we\nwill then reflect how the material past is preserved and how we refer to it. Homework available since 27 Nov.: Quiz 1\nModule 2 : (second week): The birth of archaeology and its role in the contemporary world. The\nstudy of the past of the planet marked the first serious reflections on humankind\u2019s\npast, although archaeology was in fact considered the practice to collect objects.\n\u201cNew Archaeology\u201d represents the first major revolution, promptly followed by\nthe more structured and aggressive \u201cProcessual Archaeology\". The opening towards\ndifferent disciplines implied the \u201closs of innocence\u201d for archaeology, bringing\nat the same time scientific methods into the reconstructions of the past.\nHomework available since 4 Dic.: Quiz week 2\nModule 3 (third week): The fascination of archaeology in its\npractices and in interpretation\nField archaeology entails discovery,\nbut is a matter of fact that discovering brings a great responsibility because\nit is a process of destruction. Digging means observing, recording,\ninterpreting. Archaeological excavation\nis an harmonious trade-off between an intellectual and a manual labor. In fact,\narchaeological interpretation is a path shifting between identity and alterity.\nHomework available since 11 Dic.: Quiz week 3\nModule 4 (fourth week): Archaeology in research practice\nMaterial\nremains of the past and their state of recovery vary according also to\nenvironments. Surface surveys lead to a more intense knowledge of territories,\nvisualizing archaeologicallandscapes in a variety of ecological\nsituations.&nbsp; The objectives of\narchaeological research have been moulded in the historical development of the\ndiscipline. Historical sources have always been a sourceof inspiration for\nresearch, opening new problems. Chronology is a construct depending on dating\ntools, and scientific methods have been employed in determining an absolute\nchronology.Homework available since 18 Dic.: Quiz week 4\nModule 5 (fifth week): Contemporary archaeology and public perception\nThis\nmodule focuses on scientific research and knowledge dissemination.The\nspecificities of the past pose a problem in respect of popularization and\nsimplification. The operational chain is made of exploration, dig, publication,\nconservation, dissemination, protection. However, the need for a legitimacy of\nthe present has led also to political readings of the retrieval of the past. Present cultural identity is grounded in the retrieved past. The \u201cpast of the\nother\u201d has often been refused throughout history down to modern times. Our\nperception of the past is made manifest in its material and virtual\nreconstruction starting from ruins. Further, \u201cexcessive exploitation\u201d of the\npast represent a modern destruction. The archaeological excavation of Ebla\n(Syria) will be analyzed as case study. It is in fact an example of a research\nframed within historical archaeology, which, in the course of fifty years of\nresearch, turned into a global perspective.\nHomework available since 25 Dic.: Quiz week 5\nModule 6 (six week): Digitizing Cultural Objects and 3D virtual reconstruction\nIn this module, Emanuel Demetrescu will explain us the last methodologies and techniques in the field of 3D acquisition and reconstruction of cultural heriatage. These applications improve the knowledge and preservation and have a central role in the way we can communicate cultural heritage to the society. Making digital copies from real objects now has several very fun and precise technologies that are also available to everybody at very low cost budget. Demetrescu will show us how to use these tools to make our own models and share them with others. The virtual reconstruction of no-more-exstant objects (like a lost temple) will be the argument of the last part of the module: a state of the art of the methodologies will help us to understand how to approach such a process from a scientific point of view (archaeological method). Homework available since 1 Jan.: Quiz week 6\nModule 7 (seventh week): Sharing Digital Cultural Objects over the Internet\nIn this module, Andrea Vitaletti will show us the basic techniques to effectively manage the &nbsp;unprecedented amount of digital contents on cultural objects nowadays offered by cultural heritage providers. Raw data, &nbsp;need to be organized in structured information in order to effectively support advanced functionalities, such as &nbsp;indexing and searching. We will &nbsp;present the basic techniques to structure the data in order to facilitate the access to digital contents and we will focus on &nbsp;the Europeana Data Model, a framework for collecting, connecting and enriching data on cultural objects provided by a number of museum, archives, sites and libraries in Europe.\nHomework available since 8 Jan.: Quiz week 7\nModule 8 (eight week): The past as a universal heritage of\nhumankind\nThis module deals with some basic issues and principles. All heritages are\n\u201cequal among them\u201d. Heritages are a property of humankind and not of the single\ncountries. Heritages need to be protected and preserved in their context. But\nmany threats are posed to heritages: illegal digging is a serious risk, as well\nas actions due to hatred for the \u201cother\u201d and his heritage. As a consequence of\nwhat stated above, damages to heritage are a crime against all humankind. International Organizations are engaged in protecting the heritage, the future\nof which represents a contribution to dialogue and peace.Homework available since 15 Jan.: Quiz week 8\nFinal Exam. Due by Feb. 2.\nRecommended Background\nThe course is\naimed at anyone interested in the preservation of cultural heritage and teaches\nthe methods and techniques to achieve it. In this respect, the course requires\nonly basic knowledge, which will be acquired by the end of the first cycle and\nit can be used at different levels by specialists, university students or\nmerely interested public. For this reason, the course can be useful for\napproaching these issues even in high school and, in particular, may contribute\nto the orientation towards the choice of university studies.Suggested Readings\nLecture 1:&nbsp;- Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn (2008), Archaeology: Theory, Methods and Practice, Thames and Hudson, London.- Bruce G.

Learn how web merchants such as Amazon.com personalize product suggestions and how to apply the same techniques in your own systems! Recommender systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.The algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on, with six two week projects, each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.Two Ways to Take this Course:This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals:Programming Track: &nbsp;Designed for students with significant programming and mathematics experience (see below), the programming track combines a conceptual and mathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience programming six different recommender systems projects. &nbsp;Students completing this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic recommenders from scratch, and to use software libraries and tools to implement more advanced recommenders.Concepts Track: &nbsp;Students who are not experienced programmers, or who are primarily interested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender systems, without learning to program them, can choose to focus on the conceptual and mathematical content, skipping the programming projects and associated lecture content.&nbsp; Students in the concepts track are still expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems and college-level mathematics, but need not be accomplished programmers. &nbsp;We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and business leaders, as well as engineering managers who may oversee but not directly develop recommender systems. &nbsp;We also hope it will be useful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts without the workload associated with programming those systems.&nbsp; Syllabus\nTopics covered:\nWeek 1:\nIntroduction to Course and to Recommender Systems Weeks 2 and 3:\nNon-Personalized RecommendersUnderstanding Ratings, Predictions, and RecommendationsScales and Normalization Interview with Anthony Jameson (DFKI AI Labs)\nWeeks 4 and 5:\nContent-Based RecommendersInferring PreferencesUnary Ratings Knowledge-Based Recommenders Introduction to LensKit ToolkitInterviews with Robin Burke (DePaul University) and Barry Smyth (University College Dublin)\nWeeks 6 and 7:\nCollaborative FilteringUser-User k-Nearest Neighbor ApproachTuning CF Algorithms Interviews with Paul Resnick (University of Michigan), Jen Golbeck (University of Maryland) and Dan Cosley(Cornell University)\nWeeks 8 and 9:\nEvaluation and Metrics; Error Metrics; Decision-Support MetricsComparative Evaluation: Dead Data vs. Laboratory vs. Field StudyUser-Centered Metrics and EvaluationData Sets Interview with Neal Lathia (University of Cambridge)\nWeeks 10 and 11:\nCollaborative Filtering IIItem-Item k-Nearest NeighborBusiness RulesAdjustments for Serendipity and DiversityPerformance ComparisonsHybrid Algorithms Interviews with Brad Miller (Luther College) and Robin Burke (DePaul University)\nWeeks 12 and 13:\nDimensionality Reduction RecommendersConcepts behind Latent Semantic Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition\nWeek 14:\nAlternative Recommender ApproachesInteractive RecommendersCritique and Dialog-based ApproachesAdvanced TopicsResourcesInterview with Anthony Jameson (DFKI AI Labs), Francesco Ricci (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano), Xavier Amatriain (NetFlix) and Anmol Bhasin (LinkedIn)Conclusion Recommended Background\nFor the Concepts Track students should have a basic familiarity with college-level algebra and a general understanding of computer systems concepts.For the Programming Track students should have significant skill in Java programming, basic data structures, college-level algebra, and the ability to install and manage sophisticated software development tools and libraries. &nbsp;Programming track students will install and use significant open-source software tools. Therefore, a special lecture in the first week of class will identify the tool and installation options for various computing platforms.Suggested Readings\nSpecific readings will be identified to accompany particular lectures or assignments. &nbsp;All such readings will be available to students online. &nbsp;Those interested in an introductory text are invited to consider Recommender Systems: An Introduction by Jannach et al. &nbsp;Course Format\nCourse content will consist of lecture videos (with PDFs of used slides available), online resources including review and research articles, and online discussion forums.&nbsp; Additionally, we will be recording live Q&amp;A and discussion sessions held with students enrolled for credit at the University of Minnesota; at those sessions, we will be addressing many of the top-scoring questions from the class forums.&nbsp; Course evaluation will include three components: &nbsp;written assignments, quizzes, and programming assignments (programming track only). &nbsp;While many assignments will be automatically graded, some will use peer grading; students must complete peer grading to earn credit for their own submission.&nbsp; FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment for this Course?Yes, students who complete the course with sufficiently high scores will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors. &nbsp;For the programming track, we will award a certificate of distinguished accomplishment to students who receive 80% or more of the possible points in the course. &nbsp;We will award a certificate of accomplishment to any student who receives 50% or more of the total points possible in the course -- a level that can be achieved by students in the concepts track as well. &nbsp;"}

Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti\nto Bramante\nWhen\nLeon Battista Alberti completed his\ntreatise about architecture around 1452, his initial study of texts and\nmonuments of Antiquity was based on mathematics and geometry as a reflection of\nnature, with a belief that architecture was a part of a man's civil duty.\nThis attitude would\ncondition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects\ndid not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments.\nIn Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational \u201csystem\u201d of\nBrunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with it in a return to tradition, like\nMichelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance\nwas increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed\nimmediate questions of decorative language\u00a0\n(antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of\nconceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic\nstructural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first,\nthe new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system,\nand only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural\nconceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms\nand models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first\naffirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.\nThrough some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces, technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s to Francesco di Giorgio\u2019s and Bramante\u2019s proposals.Syllabus\n1.

E. Kleiner,&nbsp;Roman Architecture: A Visual Guide&nbsp;(Yale University Press, 2014). This interactive e-book is a companion to the Roman Architecture course, featuring chapter overviews for the major time periods, sites, and monuments and concise interpretations of the most important buildings in the Roman Empire, illustrated in over 250 photographs and site plans. They provide the \u201cMonument Lists\u201d mentioned in the lectures and are presented primarily through my own digital images. Above all, these custom created resources make learning easier than ever with maps, pop up references, visual book navigation, geolocation links, flashcards, and recommendations for further reading.&nbsp;Roman Architecture: A Visual Guide is available from Apple iBooks.&nbsp;Click here to purchase the iBooks version.&nbsp;The e-book is also available for Amazon Kindle.&nbsp;Click here to purchase for Amazon Kindle.&nbsp; Click here to purchase for Google Play.&nbsp; If you have already purchased the e-book, please make sure to enable automatic e-book updates on your Apple or Amazon account settings. This will ensure that your version of the e-book will automatically update to the latest edition, which includes several new images and cross-references.Course Format\nIn order to explore the\nexpansive reach of the Roman Empire, the course unfolds over 12 weeks. All but\nthe last week include two sets of video lectures, divided into five or six\nsections of 15-20 minutes in length. Each video lecture is accompanied by\nin-video quiz questions to assess your comprehension and provide immediate\nfeedback. These are machine graded, as are the two required Mastery Quizzes. Two\nrequired 250-word writing assignments on thought-provoking problem-solving\nquestions are spread across the semester and require peer-review of other\nstudents\u2019 work. These will be assigned on Monday of the designated weeks,\ngiving you one week to complete them and a second week to peer grade. The\ncapstone project is to Design Your Own Roman City. You will concentrate in Weeks\n8 and 9 on the research and writing of the 500-word city design paper,\naccompanied by a city plan. Throughout the course, we will be interacting regularly\nin the online forum, which is an essential part of the Roman Architecture\nexperience.&nbsp;FAQ\nThis course only offers a\nVerified Certificate. It will not offer the Statement of Accomplishment. You\ncan start verifying your work for free and pay anytime before the final week of\nthe course.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Surviving Your Rookie Year of Teaching: 3 Key Ideas & High Leverage Techniques", "cat": "9/humanities|14/social_sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 409, "desc": "Learn 3 high leverage ideas and techniques to thrive in your first (or fifteenth) year of teaching. Frustration. Hard Knocks. Sleepless nights. Tears.\nThose are just a few of the ways that rookie teachers describe their first\nyear in the profession. And those sentiments have been validated by countless\nresearch studies that show that students, on average, learn significantly\nless when they\u2019re taught by rookies. Unfortunately, many educators believe\nthis is a necessary \u201crite of passage\u201d \u2013 a sort of hazing that one must\nexperience on their path to effective teaching.\nWe don\u2019t believe that.\nOver the past 6 years, the Match Teacher Residency has developed and refined\nan approach to specifically address the challenges that are unique to the\nrookie teacher experience. In this four-week course, we\u2019ll explore the\nthree ideas that we've found to contribute radically to success as a rookie\nteacher.\n\u201cIt's been a fantastic learning experience. I've taken several Coursera courses and this one is definitely the most original and creative in its approach. I suppose its main advantage is the straightforwardness of teaching, clarity and impressive visual representation. Really looking forward to Part II, where rookie teachers may grow and develop their initial knowledge even further.\u201d\u201cThis was my first Coursera course and it was\nreally helpful, although I am a 12th year teacher. One can never say that\nhe/she can manage the class successfully every day, every hour. All the advise\nwas very much appreciated. Many thanks to all: Orin, Ross, and Kat. I await\nyour next steps!\n\u201cI am happy to report that it has come in VERY\nhandy in my subbing jobs, in not only helping get the classroom management\nunder control at the start of each period, but in keeping control for the rest\nof the period.&nbsp; I even used it again yesterday, at another charter school\nwhere I sub only occasionally, and where the students are also a handful to\nmanage.&nbsp; I know the regular staff noticed and saw the effects.&nbsp; So,\nit seems I'm racking up points towards some good references when I do apply for\na permanent position!&nbsp; I have this course to thank for taking me from\nbeing an \u2018adequate\u2019 sub to being an \u2018outstanding\u2019 one!\u201d\nSyllabus\n1. Develop Classroom Management AutomaticityCertain skills that delay a novice are automatic for an expert. Dribbling a basketball. Driving a car. Addressing classroom misbehavior is similarly difficult for a novice and effortless for an expert. At one moment the novice teacher might let a particular misbehavior slide entirely; at another they might respond too harshly; and at yet another they might respond with halting uncertainty. In this part of our course, we\u2019ll cover concrete techniques and exercises that can help a rookie teacher develop the classroom management automaticity of an expert.\u00a02. Practice Good Ratio\u00a0Teachers love the spotlight. Often, a natural taste for being the center of attention might have drawn somebody to teaching in the first place. But we\u2019ve concluded that there\u2019s an inverse relationship between a teacher\u2019s talking and his/her students\u2019 learning: the more you talk, the less they learn. Doug Lemov from Uncommon Schools first coined the term \u201cRatio:\u201d the amount of teacher work in a lesson compared to the amount of student work. Rookie teachers tend to have very bad Ratio because they often spend more energy thinking about their lessons in terms of what they want to say rather than what they want their students to do. In this part of our course, we\u2019ll address when and how to use specific techniques such as \u201cTurn and Talks\u201d and \u201cStop and Jots\u201d and \u201cStudent-to-Student Interactions\u201d to get students to do more of the intellectual heavy-lifting in lessons.\u00a03. Call ParentsMany preparation programs counsel new teachers to build positive relationships with parents, but few show them exactly how to approach that work. Lacking those details, it\u2019s no surprise that rookie teachers quickly become overwhelmed by all of the aspects of their job that seem more pressing and urgent. \u201cSure it would be nice to have better relationships with parents, but it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like a priority, when I\u2019m drowning in papers to grade, lessons to plan and a messy class to organize!\u201d We understand that sentiment, but we believe a teacher should view his/her investment of time in building relationships with parents as a key strategy for motivating students to give more effort in class. In this part of the course, we will very precisely show teachers how much time to spend phoning parents, what to say, and how to say it.\u00a0Recommended Background\nWhile this course is intended for pre-service teachers, rookie teachers, and instructional coaches, veteran teachers and people considering moving into the profession have also found this course very worthwhile. \u00a0Course Format\nThis course is expected to have four highly interactive 30 minute sessions that are a mix of lecture, videos of classroom practice, and conversations with experienced teachers.\u00a0Each week will also included a supplementary reading to reinforce or examine in more depth that week's content.\u00a0Students will be assessed via two mechanisms: (1) Multiple choice quizzes that address descriptions of key concepts; and (2) short-answer analysis and description of teaching techniques. Peer assessment is required for the short-answer writing exercises. The course instructional team will schedule times after each session for interacting with students via the course\u2019s Discussion Board.\u00a0"}

La fisica del XX secolo, con le teorie della Relativit\u00e0 e della Meccanica Quantistica, ha cambiato radicalmente la visione del mondo che ci circonda. Dallo spazio e tempo assoluti e indipendenti si \u00e8 passati ad una descrizione di un mondo in cui distanze\ned intervalli di tempo dipendono da chi le osserva, in cui l\u2019ordine di accadimento di due eventi non \u00e8 sempre univoco, in cui la velocit\u00e0 del tempo segnato da un orologio dipende da quali corpi si trovino vicino. Nel microscopico si \u00e8 invece abbandonata la descrizione\ndella fisica classica, magari caotica, ma sempre deterministica, per arrivare ad una descrizione probabilistica, in cui gli stati e le propriet\u00e0 del mondo microscopico non sono determinati, a priori, intrinsecamente, ma acquisiscono realt\u00e0 solo se vengano\nmisurati o se entrino in contatto con altri \u201coggetti\u201d. L\u2019abbandono della realt\u00e0 locale, del fatto cio\u00e8 che le azioni esercitate in un luogo, per particolari sistemi, possono avere effetti istantanei su oggetti a distanze virtualmente infinite, stravolge\nla descrizione di un mondo che fino al secolo scorso sembrava sensato e ragionevole.

Provides an introduction to efficient serial and parallel computing using Fortran 90, OpenMP, MPI, and Python, and software development tools such as version control, Makefiles, and debugging. Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult. Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.&nbsp; Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic, computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.\nAlthough parallel computing will be covered, this is not a class on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead, the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop, desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.\nAlong the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.\nHigh performance programming is also an important aspect of high performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as a computational scientist.Syllabus\nThe use of a variety of languages and techniques will be integrated throughout the course as much as possible, rather than taught linearly. The topics below will be covered at an introductory level, with the goal of learning enough to feel comfortable starting to use them in your everyday work. Once you've reached that level, abundant resources are available on the web to learn the more advanced features that are most relevant for you. Working at the command line in Unix-like shells (e.g. Linux or a Mac OSX terminal). Version control systems, particularly git, and the use of Github and Bitbucket repositories. Work habits for documentation of your code and reproducibility of your results. Interactive Python using IPython, and the IPython Notebook. Python scripting and its uses in scientific computing. Subtleties of computer arithmetic that can affect program correctness. How numbers are stored: binary vs. ASCII representations, efficient I/O. Fortran 90, a compiled language that is widely used in scientific computing. Makefiles for building software and checking dependencies. The high cost of data communication.&nbsp; Registers, cache, main memory, and how this memory hierarchy affects code performance.&nbsp; OpenMP on top of Fortran for parallel programming of shared memory computers, such as a multicore laptop. &nbsp;MPI on top of Fortran for distributed memory parallel programming, such as on a cluster. Parallel computing in IPython. Debuggers, unit tests, regression tests, verification and validation of computer codes. Graphics and visualization of computational results using Python.\nRecommended Background\nExperience writing and debugging computer programs is required : Preferably experience with scientific, mathematical, or statistical computing, for example in Matlab or R. (Previous knowledge of Fortran, Python, or parallel computing languages is not assumed.)\nStudents should also be comfortable with undergraduate mathematics, particularly calculus and linear algebra, which is pervasive in scientific computing applications. Many of the examples used in lectures and assignments will require this background. Past exposure to numerical analysis is a plus.\nAll of the software used in this course is open source and freely available. A Virtual Machine will be provided that can be used to create a Linux desktop environment (with all of the required software pre-installed) that can be run on any operating system using the free VirtualBox software. An Amazon Web Services AMI will also be provided to allow doing the course work in the cloud.Suggested Readings\nCourse notes will be provided to compliment lectures. The notes and slides from lectures will also contain many references to other free resources on the web, along with some recommended books on the topics covered.Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos with integrated quiz questions. There will also be programming assignments that are not part of the lectures and optional reading material."}

This course introduces software defined networking, an emerging paradigm in computer networking that allows a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of an entire network. &nbsp; Separating a network's control logic from the underlying physical routers and switches that forward traffic allows network operators to write high-level control programs that specify the behavior of an entire network, in contrast to conventional networks, whereby network operators must codify functionality in terms of low-level device configuration. &nbsp; Logically centralized network control makes it possible for operators to specify more complex tasks that involve integrating many disjoint network functions (e.g., security, resource control, prioritization) into a single control framework, allowing network operators to create more sophisticated policies, and making network configurations easier to configure, manage, troubleshoot, and debug.&nbsp; &nbsp; Syllabus\nThis course will cover 8 modules (one per week).Module 1: History and evolution of SDNModule 2: Control and data plane separationModule 3: Control PlaneModule 4: Network VirtualizationModule 5: Data PlaneModule 6: Programming SDNsModules 7: Verification and DebuggingModule 8: Use Cases and Looking Forward\nRecommended Background Students should have taken at least an undergraduate-level networking course and have programming experience in Python.&nbsp; Experience with virtual machines and other virtual networking environments may also be useful. Suggested Readings\nThere are some useful videos available online; these&nbsp;might be a good starting point for many people:&nbsp;Prof. Nick McKeown, Stanford\"How&nbsp;SDN&nbsp;will Shape Networking\"&nbsp;Prof. Scott Shenker, Berkeley:\"An attempt to motivate and clarify Software-Defined Networking (SDN)\"(watch the first 35 minutes or so)You may find the additional reading useful for introductory material:&nbsp;&nbsp;OpenFlow: Basic description of OpenFlow&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Networking Foundation:&nbsp;For recent OpenFlow specifications, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mininet: Environment that allows you to emulate OpenFlow networks on a laptop.Course Format The course will consist of a series of video lectures, each about 10 minutes in length. Assignments for the course are lab-based programming assignments, many of which build off of the Mininet software developed at Stanford University, which can run SDNs in emulated environments on networks of virtual machines. &nbsp; FAQ\nWhat resources will I need for this class? We will use the mininet programming environment for many of the assignments for this course.&nbsp; You will want to develop some proficiency setting up virtual networks in this environment.&nbsp; In the first portion of the course, we will provide simple mininet tutorials, so it should be fairly easy to come up to speed.&nbsp; You should, however, have proficiency with basic networking concepts and facility with configuring networking in Linux environments. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? You\u2019ll learn how to use software programs to perform varying and complex networking tasks, ranging from usage management and resource control to implementation of more complicated network security policies.

Through three assignments, students will have the opportunity to plan and conceptualize a site-specific work. This course focuses on the creation of live site-specific choreography and performance works from conception to production to performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place or site, inspired by its architecture or design, its history, and/or its current use.&nbsp;Lectures and forum discussions will investigate site-based projects in both&nbsp;urban and non-urban locales, and ranging from large-scale to small (guerrilla) style productions. Furthermore, together we will delineate definitions of site-specificity, and look across the history of the field, focusing primarily on dance.\nSpecific techniques and approaches towards generating site-inspired choreography will be introduced here, but the primary focus is navigating technical issues (lighting, sound, media) and production challenges (budgeting, obtaining permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design). This is a media-rich course that features examples of site-specific work by Stephan Koplowitz to illustrate key points in the lectures, and other work shared by students in the class.Syllabus\nWeek 1: History and Context\nWhat is site-specific performance and dance? We'll define the genre through four distinct categories, and survey the range of site work in dance, performance, and installation-based practices.\nWeek 2: Working from the Outside In\nHow to deal with pre-production decisions, such as selecting and assessing a site, and putting together a working budget.\nWeek 3: Research and Staging\nHow to begin developing an artistic proposal for a site through a variety of set research \"filters.\"\nWeek 4: Production Elements\nHow to generate content as it applies to site and the concept for your work, and a survey of what you need to consider in terms of sound or music, lighting, costumes and media.\nWeek 5: Creative and Production Challenges, Part 1\nSafety issues; considerations when working in urban and natural environments; working with different production staff (costume, lighting, and sound designers) and other collaborators, such as composers or other artists.&nbsp;\nWeek 6: Creative and Production Challenges, Part 2\nStrategies for fundraising and marketing; and an overview of documenting your work.Recommended Background\nThis course is designed for anyone interested in learning about site-specific dance and performance. Prior site-specific experience in dance or theater is not required but some experience in creating dance, theater, performance or installation-based practices is recommended.&nbsp;Suggested Readings\nRecommended: Site Dance: Choreographers and the Lure of Alternative Spaces. Melanie Kloetzel and Carolyn Pavlik, eds. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 2009.Course Format\nYou are welcome to participate in this course as an observer or casual learner. You can&nbsp;watch the lecture videos, submit assignments or contribute to the discussion forums as you wish. A completion grade will be visible on your Course Records page.If you are interested in earning a Verified Certificate through Signature Track, you&nbsp;must earn a minimum number of \"points\" which equates to a passing score. Points are awarded for completing peer-assessed assignments, completing peer evaluations, and posting in select forums.&nbsp;If you complete the course without verifying your work, you will still earn a completion grade on your Course Records page.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nNo, this course no longer offers a Statement of Accomplishment and instead only offers a Verified Certificate signed by the instructor.&nbsp;To receive one, you must&nbsp;enroll in Signature Track and successfully earn a minimum number of \"points\" (through assignments, evaluations, and forum participation). Otherwise all students are welcome to engage with the course content, assignments, and discussion forum with no intention of earning a certificate.&nbsp;This course offers a Signature Track trial so that you can start verifying your work for free and pay anytime before the final week of the course. Coursera Financial Aid is also available for learners with limited economic means.\nIf you complete the course without verifying your work, you will still earn a completion grade on your Course Records page.&nbsp;\nI took the previous session of this course. Can or should I take it again?\nWe would be thrilled to have repeat students in the class. Much of the lecture content is the same, but there will be some new material and content, including some live conversations with some very special guests (to be announced). And, you will have continued access to the community of artists and additional resources within the course platform.\nI am not a dancer or choreographer. Can I still take this class?\nAbsolutely! This course is designed for anyone interested in learning about site-specific dance and performance and how to create performance works outside of the proscenium stage. Prior site-specific experience in dance or theater is not required but some experience in creating dance, theater or performance is recommended. There are many students who have taken this class and still learned a lot from the content and the community of learners.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nBesides a computer with an internet connection, to complete all of the assignments in this class you will need:&nbsp;Access to some sort of recording device for still images and/or video.A notebook to record notes, sketches and/or diagrams of your selected site.\nWhat are some things I'll learn by taking this class?\nThis course will teach you learn specific methodologies towards making performance works inspired by site. You'll also learn how to distinguish between different forms of site performance and make informed choices when working within this format. The process of conceiving of site-specific work will alter your view of the environment around you, and we hope this course will guide you to find new inspiration in the art you make.&nbsp;"}
{"lang": "en", "name": "Social Network Analysis", "cat": "5/computer_science|8/engineering_technology", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 428, "desc": "This course will use social network analysis, both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet. Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.Syllabus\nWeek 1: What are networks and what use is it to study them?\nConcepts: nodes, edges, adjacency matrix, one and two-mode networks, node degree\nActivity: Upload a social network (e.g. your Facebook social network into Gephi and visualize it ).\nWeek 2: Random network models: Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert\nConcepts: connected components, giant component, average shortest path, diameter, breadth-first search, preferential attachment\nActivities: Create random networks, calculate component distribution, average shortest path, evaluate impact of structure on ability of information to diffuse\nWeek 3: Network centrality\nConcepts: betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality (+ PageRank), network centralization\nActivities: calculate and interpret node centrality for real-world networks (your Facebook graph, the Enron corporate email network, Twitter networks, etc.)\nWeek 4: Community\nConcepts: clustering, community structure, modularity, overlapping communities\nActivities: detect and interpret disjoint and overlapping communities in a variety of networks (scientific collaborations, political blogs, cooking ingredients, etc.)\nWeek 5: Small world network models, optimization, strategic network formation and search\nConcepts: small worlds, geographic networks, decentralized search\nActivity: Evaluate whether several real-world networks exhibit small world properties, simulate decentralized search on different topologies, evaluate effect of small-world topology on information diffusion.\nWeek 6: Contagion, opinion formation, coordination and cooperation\nConcepts: simple contagion, threshold models, opinion formation\nActivity: Evaluate via simulation the impact of network structure on the above processes\nWeek 7: Cool and unusual applications of SNA\nHidalgo et al. : Predicting economic development using product space networks (which countries produce which products)\nAhn et al., and Teng et al.: Learning about cooking from ingredient and flavor networks\nLusseau et al.: Social networks of dolphins\nActivity: hands-on exploration of these networks using concepts learned earlier in the course\nWeek 8: SNA and online social networks\nConcepts: how services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, CouchSurfing, etc. are using SNA to understand their users and improve their functionality\nActivity: read recent research by and based on these services and learn how SNA concepts were appliedRecommended Background\nThere are no math or programming prerequisites for the class. There will be a few additional assignments for those with a programming background, which will use the R statistical programming language along with NetLogo.Suggested Readings\nIf you\u2019d like to get a head start, download\u00a0Gephi and explore some of its tutorials. To explore networks interactively, you can visit the\u00a0NetLogo demonstrations. If you\u2019re itching to read, the Easley and Kleinberg free text on\u00a0Networks, Crowds and Markets is excellent.

{"lang": "en", "name": "Introduction to Sociology", "cat": "14/social_sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 429, "desc": "In this class we will cover the essentials of sociology, to help you better understand your own life and situations far from your experience. We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions. \u00a0We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender. We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.Syllabus\nWeek 1: The Sociological Imagination\nWeek 2: Three Sociological Questions\nWeek 3: Methods of Sociological Research\nWeek 4: Us and Them\nWeek 5: Isolation, Groups, and Networks\nWeek 6: Cities\nWeek 7: Social Interaction and Everyday LifeRecommended Background\nNone; all are welcome.Suggested Readings\nAll assigned readings are open source materials which can be found through the web. You do not need to purchase anything. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, I will be recommending additional readings throughout the course for those who wish to delve further into particular topics. Students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what will be covered in this six week summer class can find a much more extensive coverage in my books Essentials of Sociology (Third Edition) and Introduction to Sociology (Eighth Edition) (both with Anthony Giddens, Richard P. Appelbaum, and Deborah Carr).Course Format\nEach week, there will be two sessions. One will be a standard 50 minute lecture, segmented by interactive assessments, that refers to one or two readings, all of which are in the public domain. The other will be a live discussion session via a video chat room, in which eight students -- including some selected from the students in the online class and some here at Princeton -- will participate with me in a seminar about the readings. This session will be recorded so that if you are unable to watch it live, you can view it at your own convenience. It will be really nice to have at least some of you participating from around the world. And there will also be opportunities to contribute by asking questions and making comments on the course website. Some of my colleagues in the Princeton sociology department have agreed to join us for these sessions. A midterm examination will be available as will a final examination. These exams will consist of a combination of identification questions and short essay questions.FAQ\nDoes Princeton award credentials or reports regarding my work in this course?\nNo certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.\n"}

We address not only the identification of new disease risk factors (e.g., deficient social capital) but also how well-known exposures (e.g., cigarette smoking, lead paint, health insurance) emerge and are maintained by the social system. This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad\nperspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such\nas familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces\n-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing\nevidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant\nto the topic.\nThe course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental\ncauses of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.\nFor example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people\ndifferently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is\na narrowly defined medical problem.\nStudents in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,\nand complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability\nto synthesize ideas.\nUpon completion of the course students should: have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health of populations, be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature that address the causes of disease, be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status, and&nbsp; be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical for policy making.\nSyllabus\nWeek 1: &nbsp;Background and History\nWhat is social epidemiology and where did it come from?

Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a \u201csoul.\u201d While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what\nwe can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about\nthe soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and\nafterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to\nassuming souls exist?\u00a0 Are there brain\nstructures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the\nfoundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many\nreligions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and\nour collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in\nreligion, science, politics, and war?

{"lang": "en", "name": "Principles of Microeconomics", "cat": "6/economics_finance", "provider": "Coursera", "id": 442, "desc": "Learn how markets work, what they accomplish well and what their limitations are. We make economics\ndecisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to\nstudy. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our\ndecisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to\nproduce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us.\u00a0This\ncourse is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of\nmarkets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We\nwill explore what outcomes they generate when they work well\nand what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are\nimportant and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples\nare taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all\npurchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and\npolicy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be\nan educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and\nevaluate market outcomes. Syllabus\nWeek One: Where do\nmarkets come from? We will start with understanding the constraint of scarcity\nthat we face and the concept of opportunity cost that reflects the true cost of any decision we make.Week Two: We will discuss how gains from specialization according to our comparative advantage allows us to use our resources efficiently. We will apply these concepts to a simple model of trade.Week Three: We will introduce the\nbasic model of Supply & Demand. This will allow you to communicate with other economists\nand finally understand those business pages and market updates. Week Four: There is a lot of terminology this week. We will introduce of the concept of elasticity to discuss effects of price\nand income changes on market outcomes.Then we will explore the\ngreat accomplishment of markets: maximizing the size of the pie or the total benefit to society.Week Five: What\nhappens when government intervenes in the market? We will analyze\nprice floors and ceilings, taxes and subsidies and learn how the best intentions sometimes lead to very unfortunate results.\nWeek Six:\nIntroduction to firms\u2019 decisions: understanding firms\u2019 cost\ncurves and the goal of profit maximization.\nWeek Seven: The\nPerfectly Competitive Market: what is it? does it exist? why is it a\ncrucial benchmark? Week Eight:\nMonopolies of various types: one price monopoly, natural monopoly,\nprice discrimination and monopolistic competition. What market\noutcomes do we get in each case? How should government intervene in\nsuch cases?\nWeek Nine: Understanding the market for labor. Defining employment and unemployment. We will learn about the minimum wage and the concerns economist have with setting it too high. We will also learn of cases were minimum wage makes senseWeek Ten: When\nmarkets fail: externalities and public good. We will cover the classical approach to these topics as well as introduce a few simple concepts from Game Theory to understand the Tragedy of the Commons.\nWeek Eleven: Poverty\nand inequality: how do we measure these? How do we balance our\nconcern about poverty and inequality while allowing markets to work\nfor the benefit of society at large? \u00a0\u00a0Recommended Background\nEconomics requires thinking in three\n\u201clanguages\u201d: words, graph and mathematical notation. All concepts\nare introduced slowly and gradually, but comfort with thinking\nanalytically will be helpful.Suggested Readings\nThere are many wonderful introductory texts to Microeconomics that you could use to supplement the Coursera material. At the University of Pennsylvania I have been using Michael Parkin\u2019s \u201c Principles of Microeconomics\u201d as I find it especially rigorous and accurate. You are welcome to use any basic text or none at all.\nI do recommend reading economic newspapers and popular books on the topic. My favorite is The Economist, especially the Business and the Finance and Economics sections. This course will help your fluency in understanding such material. Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture\nvideos which are between 8 and 15 minutes long. Each video will\ninclude integrated questions\u00a0to help\u00a0you assess your\ncomprehension. There are weekly assignments. Each week there will be a\n10 question multiple choice assessment. We will also have six extended assignments in the course that require applying the model, our graphs and numerical examples to analyze an example based on recent news article. Three of these assignments will be auto graded and three will be peer assessments.There is a final exam. You will have two weeks to complete it.\nFAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nFor more information on Penn\u2019s Open Learning initiative, please go to:http://openlearning.upenn.edu/"}

This\ncourse will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on\nmammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.\nAs our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists\nof molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need\nto understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that\nact as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal\ntransduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn\nthese processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,\nproliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular\nand cellular systems? What are the\nmechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level\nthinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these\nsystems?\nThe course will develop multiple lines of\nreasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads\nare: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that\nproduce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate\n\u201chow\u201d cell- level functions arise and \u201cwhy\u201d mechanistic knowledge allows us to\npredict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.Syllabus\nTopics covered include:Systems Level Reasoning: Bottom-Up and Top-Down Approaches for Complex SystemsCell Signaling Pathways: Molecules to Pathways, cAMP and MAP-kinase PathwaysSignal Flow: Pathways to NetworksThe Actin Cytoskeleton: The Cell Motility MachineMathematical Representations of Cell Biological Systems Time and SpaceGathering Large Data Sets in Genomics and ProteomicsInferring Modules: Computational Analysis of Large Data Sets; Building NetworksSmall Scale Systems Biology ExperimentsIdentifying Emergent Properties by Computation: Dynamical Models Emergent Properties: Ultrasensitivity, Bistability, Robustness and FragilityModules to Functions: Control SystemsModule-Boundaries: Sharp and Fuzzy, Interactions between Subcellular ModulesEmergence of Cellular Functions from Subcellular ModulesSystems Analysis of Complex DiseasesSystems Pharmacology: Understanding Drug Action from a Systems PerspectiveRecommended Background\nUndergraduate introductory\ncell biology; familiarity with statisticsSuggested Readings\nReview articles and\nselected original research articles are discussed in the lectures. A set of\nreview articles will be required reading. Reading primary articles is not\nrequired to complete the course, but can be quite useful. All materials will be from open access journals or will be provided as links to e-reprints, so there will be no cost to the student.Course Format\nEach\nclass session will consist of an approximately one hour lecture, divided into\nmultiple shorter segments.\nFor evaluation, students will be given homework assignments\nthat will require critical reasoning and problem solving skills. Questions may\nbe multiple choice or short (100 -300 word) essays.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes.

This course is designed to help science teachers infuse their curriculum with hands-on STEM activities that support the NGSS engineering practices. This is a hands-on workshop that explores various strategies that middle and high school teachers can use to integrate engineering practices into science lessons and laboratory\ninvestigations that they already do. We will start by comparing and contrasting the research methods employed by scientists and engineers, then demonstrate ways that teachers can facilitate, sequence, and assess lessons designed to help students understand and apply engineering principles. These principles include learning to (1) design within constraints, (2) analyze and interpret data, (3) construct models, and (4) conduct iterative tests. Upon completing this course, teachers will possess a deeper understanding of engineering and be able to effectively teach engineering processes to their students.Syllabus\nWeek One: Learning from FailureOne of the best ways to introduce and understand engineering practices is by studying real-life examples, including what went wrong. We'll look at some famous engineering failures (and successes) and explore teaching applications.Week Two: Science and Engineering ThinkingThe Next Generation Science Standards explicitly call out the differences between science and engineering. We'll use exhibits from the Exploratorium museum floor to illustrate some of these differences, and ask you to re-imagine your own science activity from an engineering perspective.Week Three: Modeling ActivitiesA hallmark of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute is that we have developed lots of \"snacks\" over the years: hands-on teaching activities (thoroughly tested by students and teachers) that explore scientific phenomena using easy-to-obtain materials. This week, we'll share some of our favorites and ask you to try them out at home. Week Four: Develop Your Own Engineering ActivityIt's your turn! Take what you've learned in the class and create your own mini-lesson. You can adapt one of our activities or come up with your own and get feedback and tips from other students in the class.Recommended Background\nThis course is appropriate for any middle or high school teacher interested\nin learning how to incorporate engineering activities into their science\ncurriculum. Formal training in the physical or life sciences is highly\nrecommended (BA/BS in science or equivalent).Suggested Readings\nWe recommend that participants familiarize themselves with the Next Generation Science Standards (specifically, the engineering practices) before starting this course.\nThe website nextgenscience.org gives a good overview of the new standards, which is organized along three primary dimensions.\nThe full text of the NGSS framework is available for free from the National Academies Press: A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices,\nCrosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas\nYou can also watch these short videos from Paul Anderson of Bozeman Science, which do a great job of explaining specific NGSS practices in detail:\nETS1A - Defining &amp; Delimiting an Engineering Problem\nETS1B - Developing Possible Solutions\nETS1C - Optimizing the Design Solution\nETS2A -\nInterdependence of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology\nETS2B -\nInfluence of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology on Society &amp; the Natural\nWorldCourse Format\nEach week will include 2-4 short videos highlighting aspects of engineering practice.\nCourse participants will be asked to try out some activities and also reflect on and critically examine the engineering activities. Participants will also examine strategies for monitoring student learning. Links to engineering activities and teaching resources will be provided. There will also be readings and assignments to complete.FAQ\n\u2022 &nbsp;Will I get a certificate after completing this class that I can show to my district?\nYes.

On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement Teaching\nis isolating. &nbsp;Most of the work happens behind a closed door.\n&nbsp;Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter three\nproblems:\n1.\nThey don't get much. &nbsp;The principal or department head doesn't visit very\noften. &nbsp;And there\u2019s no built-in structure at their school for peer\nobservation. 2.\nThe feedback isn't helpful or actionable. Sometimes\nit's just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and\nwhile everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say \"you were\nwonderful\" don't make better teachers. &nbsp;Or sometimes the feedback is\ncritical in ways that don\u2019t present clear next steps. &nbsp;Sometimes it's\nvague or just plain wrong. &nbsp;\n3.\nSome teachers can be defensive. &nbsp;\n(Yes,\nwe know \u2013 only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU. &nbsp;You are different.\n&nbsp;You handle feedback with grace, confidence, and a \"let's fix\nthis\" orientation. {Except&nbsp;sometimes maybe not.}) ***\nThis\ncourse is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their own\nimprovement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about their\nteaching. The\nidea may be simple, but the work is not. So we should say straight up: this\nis NOT a typical MOOC. Participants in this MOOC won\u2019t improve their\nteaching skills by just watching lectures. Participants also won\u2019t really take\nanything away from this MOOC if they do it \u201ca la carte:\u201d we believe they need\nto do every part of every assignment in order to leverage the kinds of changes\nin practice that we think are possible in a course like this. We\nall wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would have\neasy access to great coaching \u2013 or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately that\u2019s\nnot the world we live in. Indeed, high school athletes can EXPECT to be\ncoached, but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachers\ndeserve better. But they have a choice: bemoan\nthe lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get, or\nbecome the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop. &nbsp;\nClass\n1: The Big Picture on Teacher Feedback\nWe\nwill review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools, looking at\nwhere that feedback usually comes to teachers and how it\u2019s processed.&nbsp; In\nmost schools, the teacher plays a passive role in this\u2014waiting until an\nevaluation comes to them.&nbsp; We believe the best teachers create the\nopposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback, drag it back to their lairs,\nand use it. &nbsp;They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come to\nthem, they might wait a long, long time. &nbsp;\nClass\n2:&nbsp; Case Study: Peer Feedback\nWe\nprofile teachers&nbsp;who've&nbsp;asked their peers to give them critical\nfeedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric or\nobservation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on after\nthey got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacher\nwrite? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps?\nWhat did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weeks\nlater? Participants\nin this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedback\nfrom a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on its\nimplementation. Participants will also be assigned to give and receive feedback\non these action plans from other students in our MOOC who are working on\nsimilar focus areas in similar contexts (e.g. other math teachers who are\ntrying to improve the rigor of their questioning). Class\n3:&nbsp;Case Study: Student Feedback &nbsp;\nFirst\nwe review the emerging new evidence, from the Gates Foundation MET Project,\nabout student surveys and their power for accurately assessing teachers\u2019\nstrengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;Then, similar to the Peer Feedback class, we\nshow a teacher going through all the steps, interspersed with commentary from\nthe course instructor.\nAgain,\nour MOOC participants will do the same assignment: create a student survey\n(we\u2019ll show you examples); administer the survey; tabulate the data; write and\nimplement a plan; and get and give feedback from/to a peer with a similar focus\narea. Class\n4: Case Study: Assessment Data\nFirst\nwe cover the evidence of how schools and teachers are using student assessment\ndata to drive instructional improvements. Then we once again examine examples\nof teachers who go through all of the steps of administering a unit assessment,\nanalyzing the data, and designing and implementing a targeted instructional\nintervention. MOOC\nparticipants will do the same assignment, and then get and give feedback\nfrom/to a peer who teaches a similar subject and/or grade level. &nbsp;\nCourse\nLearning Outcomes:\nTo describe both structural and psychological\nimpediments to teachers receiving effective feedback about their practice, as\nwell as strategies to overcome those impediments.&nbsp;To engage in self-directed improvement via three\ntypes of data collection\u2014action plan\u2014reflection assignments: peer observation,\nstudent surveys, and student assessment data analysis.To provide critical support and feedback to fellow\nMOOC participants who have similar teaching contexts and/or improvement focus\nareas.&nbsp;\nRecommended Background\nYou must be actively teaching in some type of K-12 setting in order to take this course. That's the only prerequisite.&nbsp;Course Format\nThis course is expected to have four\n60-minute interactive sessions that are a mix of video-based case studies and\nself-monitored writing exercises.Students will complete three types of assignments in response to each of\nthe three feedback case studies:&nbsp;(1) A 2 page written action plan that\naddresses the feedback that you collected.&nbsp;(2) A 2 page written reflection that\naddresses the implementation of your action plan.&nbsp;(3) An assessment of\nanother course participant\u2019s action plan/reflection assignment.\nStudents will have three weeks between class sessions in which to\ncomplete each assignment. For example, after the Peer Feedback Case Study\nclass, students will have three weeks to collect peer feedback, write an action\nplan, implement and reflect on their action plan, and then assess the work of\nanother course participant. Students\nshould\nplan to spend 3-4 hours between sessions completing coursework."}

This course explores key ideas of positive psychology and shows how great teachers apply those lessons to maximize student engagement and accomplishment. Through lectures, discussions, interviews and footage of great educators in action, you\u2019ll learn how to integrate character-based objectives into your own teaching. Psychology, sociology, and neuroscience point to the existence of a set\nof developable character strengths that serve as building blocks for positive\nlife outcomes. That\u2019s why, in our view, character development and content\nmastery act as the two complementary halves of remarkable teaching. But\nthey\u2019re often perceived to be in competition. When you ask parents about\ntheir goals for their children, they almost always respond with terms like,\n\u201csuccessful,\u201d \u201chappy,\u201d\n\u201ccurious,\u201d and \u201cbeing kind to others.\u201d But when you ask schools\nabout their goals, they often reply in terms of academic content, like \u201calgebra,\u201d \u201csubject-verb\nagreement,\u201d and \u201cthe periodic table.\u201d Great teachers have always united those two visions.\nThis course explores the interconnection between character research, education,\nand academic rigor.

It will help you to analyze and understand these complex phenomena and discuss its impact on society with a global audience. Students, policy makers, journalists or anyone with a strong interest in understanding issues like the history, origins and nature of terrorism, security, fear management, resilience, politics, violence, foreign fighters and radicalization will find the course most relevant. Terrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since \u20189/11\u2019 terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making. As a response to the ongoing developments in Iraq and Syria, a module has been added that looks into the issue of foreign fighters.Testimonials of students who completed this courseI've been studying one particular aspect of the field for about fifteen years now, but lacked the sort of wider context that this course has provided. And I've made contacts here that I hope will develop into friendships.Charles Cameron, 69, Blogger Religious Studies, UKThis has been a wonderfully enriching experience. I have learned a lot, and have especially appreciated the worldwide perspectives of the class found in the discussion forum. Being in this class has helped me open up the subject to discussion with colleagues and friends, which has led to interesting and insightful conversations. The class materials were effective and polished. The peer reviewed assignments were challenging and fun. This was my first MOOC, but certainly not my last!&nbsp;&nbsp;Joella Givens, 50, GIS Manager at a state government Department of Transportation, USAThe theoretical aspect was similar to the one offered by well respected universities for introductory courses on terrorism. For just 5 weeks, I think this course covered a lot of ground. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the discussion forums. (...)In addition, I found excellent recommendations on books, articles, documentaries, all of great quality.Arete Ketekidou, 32, Research/Analyst, GreeceI like very much the freedom we have to study, this is the best incentive, not only because we can express our ideas on forums freely and manage our own time, also because Professor Bakker has not been imposing his ideology on this topic.

Every dog owner should have some understanding of reproduction, whether they intend to breed that dog or just want to have their dog spayed or castrated. As a dog enthusiast, you want to know what is best for your dog and to understand your veterinarian\u2019s recommendations. This course is intended to give you the background knowledge necessary to help you achieve those goals. Students in this course will learn the basics of anatomy and reproductive physiology necessary to understand reproduction control, and the diagnosis and management of reproductive tract disease in male and female dogs. My goal is to provide you with background information that will help you work with your veterinarian to make the best decisions for your dog.Syllabus\nWeek 1: Female dog anatomy / The estrous cycleWeek 2: Breeding management /\u00a0Pregnancy and whelpingWeek 3: Female dog reproductive tract disordersWeek 4: Male dog anatomy / Semen collection and evaluation / Artificial inseminationWeek 5: Male dog reproductive tract disordersWeek 6: Contraception and sterilization of female and male dogsRecommended Background\nParticipants should have a basic grasp of biology and general familiarity with dog anatomy and normal dog behavior. Suggested Readings\nMuch of the material for this course will be taken from The Dog Breeder\u2019s Guide to Successful Breeding and Health Management (ISBN:1-4160-3139-1). Another text that is very helpful for dog breeders is Canine Reproduction by Phyllis Holst (ISBN 978-1-57779-114-0). Students with purebred dogs also may find much information on the website from their national breed club, especially for those with breeds registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Finally, all students should feel free to contact their veterinarian with questions or concerns about any dog for which\u00a0you are responsible. Course Format\nI will start each session with a case for you to think about, provide a couple of brief video lectures (5-15 minutes in length) followed by short activities\u00a0to check your understanding. We'll conclude each session with a review of the most important points and an explanation of the case with which we started. For more advanced students, a question will be posted that will require you to find\u00a0your own resources.\u00a0I will also provide\u00a0references\u00a0to written materials that may help you better understand the concepts or to learn more about topics of particular interest to you.I will be using correct veterinary terminology throughout the course, both in written materials and in video presentations. That means that I will refer to an unspayed female dog as a bitch. I also will be using correct terms for anatomy. This is not intended to be shocking or unsettling. Use of correct terminology ensures clear understanding. Similarly, some images may be graphic but they are used to demonstrate a disease state or correct performance of a procedure and are intended for your education.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment for this course? Yes. Students who complete the course will receive a Statement of Accomplishment\u00a0signed by the instructor."}

Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry\nthat relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior\nof chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the\nconstruction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described.\nThermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, and\ntheir relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of\nThermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes\nplace primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course\ncovers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical\nthermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase\nequilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, and\nchemical reaction equilibria. Students who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how changes in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior of those substances; they will understand the relationships between energy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be extracted from a given chemical process under various sets of conditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and chemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and manipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and state functions.\nSyllabus\nTopics covered:Week 1:Overview of thermodynamics and its importance and utility.Molecular energy levels from quantum mechanics.Week 2:Ideal gases; Equations of state; PV diagrams.Gases and liquids; Corresponding states.Dispersion; Intermolecular interactions; Real gases.Week 3:Boltzmann probability and connection to energy; Ensemble properties.Heat capacity; Partition functions.Atomic and molecular partition functions; Connections to quantum mechanics (statistical thermodynamics).Week 4:Electronic and translational partition function for gases; Rovibrational partition functions.Heat capacities.Week 5:First law of Thermodynamics; Energy; PV Work; State functions.Adiabaticity; Reversibility; Heat and work.Enthalpy; Heat capacity redux; Heat of transition.Enthalpy of chemical reaction; Heat of formation; Standard-state enthalpy.Week 6:Second law; Order/disorder; Entropy.Spontaneity and entropy; Statistical thermodynamics and entropy; Reversibility.Entropy and the interconversion of heat and work; Entropy and the partition function.Week 7:Third law; Temperature limits; Perfect crystals; Phase transitions.Experimental determination of third-law entropies; Standard-state entropy.Week 8:Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies; Ensemble conditions.Maxwell relations; Ideal gas state functions; Independent variables.Gaseous standard state; Gibbs-Helmholtz equation; Fugacity.Recommended Background\nOne year of college-level physics. One year of college-level general chemistry. Differential calculus of multiple variables.Suggested Readings\nThere are many textbooks available for introductory thermodynamics.

We discuss parts of the upper limb, the anatomy of bones, joints and muscles, nerve injuries and common pathologies. In the first six weeks of the course, we begin with an introduction to the parts of the upper limb and a discussion of the anatomic position, including the three-dimensional planes in which body movements are performed. Next, we cover the osteology of\nthe upper limb by describing the bones of the extremity, how they articulate at synovial joints, and the movements that are possible at these joints. We explore the blood supply and innervation to the upper limb. We then discuss the major muscles that\nact at each joint, pointing out what muscles allow us to shrug our shoulders, row a boat, make a fist, and rotate our hand forwards or backwards.\nIn the final three weeks of the course, we investigate nerve injuries that occur in the upper limb and their clinical effects. We also explore common pathologies that appear in the extremity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, and Dupuytren's\ncontracture. We finish with a description of the embryologic development of the upper limb and common causes of limb malformations and deformations.\nPlease note that some lectures in this course contain graphic medical images, including illustrations of the human body, and photographs of birth defects and other medical conditions.

A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast: &nbsp;billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called \u201cintellectual property\u201d or IP blocks). &nbsp;How do people manage to design these complicated chips? &nbsp;Answer: &nbsp;a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. &nbsp;Our focus is on the key representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, these designs, as they move from logic to layout. &nbsp; Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. You should be taking this course if (1) you are interested in building VLSI design tools; &nbsp;(2) you are interested in designing VLSI chips, and you want to know why the tools do what they do; &nbsp;(3) you just like cool algorithms, that work on big cool problems that involve bits, and gates, and geometry, and graphs, and matrices, and time, and...Syllabus\nTopics covered will include: Computational boolean algebra; logic verification; logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level); technology mapping; timing analysis; ASIC placement and routing.Recommended Background\nProgramming experience (C++, Java) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms. &nbsp;An understanding of basic digital design: &nbsp;Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design. &nbsp;Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering. &nbsp;Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but it\u2019s not necessary. &nbsp;We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained. &nbsp;However, we will offer pointers to original source material, i.e., papers in conferences and journals. &nbsp;This area lacks a single, established \u201cfront-to-back\u201d text, that covers logic and layout, as well as representation, optimization, synthesis and verification. &nbsp;So, we will work to be as complete as possible in the lectures.\nCourse Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 15 and 20 minutes in length. &nbsp;There will also be standalone problem sets (homeworks) that are not part of video lectures, a few programming assignments, and a (not optional) final exam.FAQ\nWill I get a certificate for this course?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.\nAm I going to learn how to use any industrial design tools in this class?\nNope. This is not a course about \u201cusing\u201d other people\u2019s tools. So, it\u2019s not a standard \u201cVLSI Design\u201d sort of a class. This is a course about building software design tools.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nYou need access to a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer to be able to write, compile and run programs. You should be able to program in a modern programming language like Java or C++ or Python. For some programming assignments, you can use any language you like, as long as you can read our input files and write our output file formats.\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nHow it\u2019s possible to synthesize logic and layout using cool algorithms and data structures. Let\u2019s face it: you can build a Karnaugh map with about 6-7 variables, and beyond this your head explodes. Modern designs have a million gates.

A materials-based understanding of the evolution of erupting systems provides a quantitative physico-chemical description of the nature of lava and magma and the role of experiments in quantifying the eruptive process. Geoscientists define\na \u201cliving planet\u201d as one with active volcanism. By this definition our Earth is\nvery much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of\n\u201cactive volcanoes\u201d that can potentially erupt in any given year.&nbsp;In detail, each eruption is\ndifferent. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in its\nown geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at its\nown stage in evolution in geological time.&nbsp;\nExternal triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play an\nimportant role.Yet powerful generalisations\nand models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful in\ndealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions.\nHow are such models\nconstructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of what\nvolcanoes are, and what they are doing \u2013 not just during eruptions but also in\nthe events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earth\u00b4s surface but\nalso at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption.In addition to\nfield observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmatic\nsystems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly,\nhigh pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answer\nthe question of how volcanic systems work.\nThese controlled laboratory conditions\nfor experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from a\nchiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed via\ntheoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientific\ndiscipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected,\nby the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not.This course shows you how such experimental insight is&nbsp;obtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.Syllabus\nWeek 1: The Earth as a living planet: The five big extinctions during Phanerozoic times; Volcanic fatalities; Volcanism in the Solar system; Volcanism on Earth; The essence of volcanism;Week 2: The Earth as a living planet: Volcanoes on Earth: magnitudes and landforms; Explosive and effusive volcanism; Videos of Merapi and Etna volcanoes; Volcanic materials; mineralogy and fragment classification; Chemical and mineralogical classification;&nbsp;Week 3: Structure of molten silicates: Chemical composition; Stability and geological properties (an overview on viscosity/viscoelasticity; density, expansivity/compressibility; Volatiles solubilities, diffusivities, heat capacity, redox equilibria);&nbsp;Week 4: Dynamics of molten silicates: Glass and molten silicates; Molar heat, Enthalpy: Strain vs. time; Cooling vs. heating paths; Maxwell relations for viscoelasticity; Resistivity and viscosity; Relaxation times and implications for experiments;&nbsp;Week 5: Relaxation in silicate melts: Longitudinal vs. shear viscosity; Glass transition; Quench rate, relaxation time and viscosity; The role of water content, water speciation, pressure and temperature; Details of water speciation from experimental data;Week 6: Diffusion in silicate melts: water content and water speciation &nbsp;(cont.); Diffusion in contrasting silicate melts; The role of temperature; Comparing diffusion of different elements; The role of pressure; Simplified Stokes-Einstein and Eyring equations; Relaxation times &nbsp;(comparison between different compositions at different temperatures);Week 7: Expansivity and compressibility in silicate melts: Partial molar volumes; Density: equation of state for liquid silicates; Density determinations and calculations above and below glass transition; Density models for anhydrous granitic system;Week 8: Viscosity of silicate melts: Calibration of reaction kinetics for speciation (e.g. H2O); Prediction of glass transition: temperature, thermodynamic and kinetic; Methods of viscosity measurements; Arrhenian and non-Arrhenian plots; Viscosity-temperature relationships; Peraluminous and metaluminous (calcalkaline) melts; Adam Gibbs model: entropy of mixing; Multicomponent models with water and fluorine;Week 9: Fragmentation of magmas: The role of crystals and bubbles; Bubble growth; Structural relaxation; Non-Newtonian effects; Viscous heating; Flow or blow: the volcanic dilemma; Fragmentation velocities; Experimental Volcanology at the LMU; Videos from the labs and scientific staff;Week 10: Volcanic hazards: how to get information from volcanological maps; Impact and relevance; Volcanoes and Mankind; Hazards mitigation; Examples from the Vesuvius case; Video from Vesuvius with animations;Recommended Background\nBasic mathematics, physics and chemistry.&nbsp;Suggested Readings\nAlthough the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend (but do not require) that students refer to the suggested reading at the end of the chapters.FAQ\nAre the students going to receive a certificate for this course?Students will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor if they successfully solve more than 50% of the final Quiz questions.What resources are required for this course?For this course, all you need is an Internet connection and the time to learn the proposed topics.What is the main goal of this course?This course aims to help those with a good basic background in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, understanding of the evolution of erupting systems.

We have no immediate threat emanating from a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than the days of the Soviet Union.

We reflect on the two opposite meanings of the word \"appropriate,\" examine multitrack recording, and consider the \"collaborative\" process in world music production.\nWeek Three: Tuvan Throat Singers, we examine how nomadic pastoralists from the Russian republic called Tanna Tuva have become world music superstars because of a single field recording made by an ethnomusicologist in the late 1980s.\nWeek Four: Pygmy Pop? We discuss \"pygmies\" in the western imagination, and uses of \"pygmy\" music in northern hemisphere popular culture to ask about the ethics of recorded music appropriations.\nWeek Five: Australian Aboriginal group Yothu Yindi embraced a discourse of cultural and musical reconciliation, and mixed the language of rock with traditional sounds as a successful political strategy in the 1990s.\nWeek Six: Kalahari Bushmen or Khoisan, are perhaps the oldest existing human communities. We discuss their traditional music, the 1970s Gods Must Be Crazy commercial film, and appropriation and reclamation of Khoisan heritage by South Africans in post-apartheid South Africa.\nWeek Seven: Cuba, the 1990s Buena Vista Social Club sound recording and documentary film, and a brief discussion of Cuban contemporary history and music are the subject of this final class.\nRecommended Background\nThough it may be useful, you are not required to have any music theoretical knowledge to take the class. \u00a0You will learn not just about \u201cmusic\u201d as absolute sound, but about how music works in particular communities, and as a globally distributed, and often politically contested, entity.Suggested Readings\nThere is no single book published on this material, though reference is made to scholarly literature and recordings in the course of each lecture.Course Format\nThe class will consist of lecture videos and discussions of youtube music clips, which are between 8 and 15 minutes in length. Video clips contain an integrated quiz question or short matching quiz. \u00a0There will also be standalone homework discussion forums that are not part of video lectures, and a (not optional) final exam.FAQ\nWill I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\nYes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.\nWhat do I need for the class?\nAn inquiring mind and ears open to hearing a wide range of sound. Access to Youtube.\nWhat is meant by \u201cworld music\u201d?\nWorld Music is a marketing category created by the music industry in the late 1980s for music not traditionally considered \u201cmainstream\u201d by the industry. The term doesn\u2019t mean we will cover all of the world\u2019s music in 7 weeks. Rather we focus briefly on a handful of musical cultures to examine ways in which music has been harnessed by communities and individuals in the contemporary world for a variety of purposes.\nDoes it matter that I don\u2019t have any music theoretical knowledge? Will I need to be able to notate music?\nNo. You will learn to listen to, and discuss the music you hear in several ways. Graduate students from the University of Pennsylvania provide examples of how they hear the music, to encourage you to do similarly. You are given basic musical vocabulary relevant to each unit.\nWhat resources will I need for this class?\nAll musical examples used in the class come from Youtube, though there are many online resources you may know yourselves for locating musical examples that are either free or available for a small fee. We will make reference to a range of recordings and films that you may wish to locate and view in your own time. It will be an added bonus if you know about and inform other students in the class about further resources on a subject or community discussed in this course.\nWhat is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nYour ears will open to new sounds, your mind to new understanding of these sounds, your playlist will grow, and you will expand your knowledge of the world through its extraordinary range of music.How do I connect with the course on social media?You can join the Listening to World Music student community on Facebook, follow the course on Twitter, or add it to your circles on Google+.For more information on Penn\u2019s Open Learning initiative, please go to:http://openlearning.upenn.edu/\n"}

Unit processes involved in the two treatment chains will be described as well as the physical, chemical and biological processes involved. There will be an emphasis on water quality and the functionality of each unit process within the treatment chain.\u00a0 After the course one should be able to recognise the process units, describe their function and make simple design calculations on water treatment\u00a0 plants (drinking and waste water).\u00a0 Overall the course will teach the role of treatment technologies in providing adequate water supply and effective sanitation which are essential for human society and the safeguarding of public and environmental health.\nThere is a global trend towards urbanisation with over 50% of humanity currently residing in urban areas. Water is invariably linked to urban functionality, as industrial, domestic and agricultural use. Essential services such as drinking water supply, sanitation and wastewater treatment to protect surface water and groundwater resources need to be present in such environment. The provision of these essential urban water services present real challenges in many parts of the world today.\nAccessible fresh water resources suitable for drinking water and other ecosystem services is approximated to be 200,000 km3, approximately 0.3% of the total freshwater resources and less than 0.01% of the total water on earth. These accessible freshwater resources are not equally distributed and many countries today are experiencing water scarcity which in turn affects community health and in many places water scarcity is the inhibiting factor for economic growth. This highlights the importance of conserving and protecting the accessible freshwater resources, through the implementation of adequate treatment technologies combined with a robust infrastructure. Through utilising relevant treatment technologies to upgrade water to a quality suitable for subsequent use or discharge with more and more stringent effluent demands, the urban water chain has the possibility to transform to an urban water cycle and improve interactions within the greater hydrological cycle.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

About this Course Should we clone humans? Who owns our DNA? How much control should we have over how and when we die? When does medical treatment turn into medical enhancement \u2014 and should we care? Is rationing health care good, bad, necessary \u2014 or all of the above?\nThis course will explore fundamental moral issues that arise in medicine, health, and biotechnology. Get behind the headlines \u2014 and polarized debates \u2014 and join others who want to think deeply and openly about these problems. Some are as old as life itself: the vulnerability of illness, the fact of death. Some are new, brought on by a dizzying pace of technology that can unsettle our core ideas about human nature and our place in the world. And nearly all intersect with issues of racial and gender equality, as well as policies affecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations.\nDesigned to introduce students to the range of issues that define bioethics, together with core concepts and skills, this course should be of interest to undergraduates, health care professionals, policy makers, and anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

About this Course This course will be offered in an experimental format and will not include any graded assignments or offer certificates at the conclusion of the course.\nThe Poetry of Early New England introduces students to the most important poets of the 17th century, including Anne Bradstreet, Michael Wigglesworth and Edward Taylor. Texts range from theological verse dramas to intimate love poems, \u00a0from meditations on nature, family and death to reflections on the civic and communal hopes of the New England migrants. Students will be exposed to relevant poetic forms and traditions, \u00a0to rare manuscript and printed materials, and they will have opportunities to practice and refine the way they read, and write about, poems. Course materials include video lectures, roundtable and online discussions--but also interactive exercises and interpretive expeditions to key New England sites.\nPoetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of poetry in America. \u00a0Treating individual figures (Poe, Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, Williams, Hughes), major poetic movements (Firesides, Modernist, New York, Confessional, L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E) and probing the many uses of poetry across changing times, the course provides a historical time line for the American poetic tradition while also giving students tools to approach any poetic tradition. Who, and what, are poems for? For poets? Readers? To give vent to the soul? To paint or sculpt with words? Alter consciousness? Raise cultural tone?

About this Course *Note - This is an Archived course*\nThis is a past/archived course. At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.\nWhat is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.\nThe classical Greeks' concepts of Heroes and the \"heroic\" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.\nIn Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship \u2013 a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.\nThe original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue \"On Heroes\" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach's opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott's science fiction classic Blade Runner).\nThe true hero of the course is the logos (\"word\") of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or \"slow\") reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer's epics and ends with Plato's memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.\nUsing modern technology and engaging texts, The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.
